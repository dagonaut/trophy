Annealed (God of Austerity)

* Length: Centuries

- **Era Overview**: Bellmead began as a cloister dedicated to austere living and the pursuit of higher learning. The God of Austerity, Annealed, was worshiped by the early scholars and monks, who believed in the virtues of self-denial, discipline, and intellectual purity. Knowledge was sought for its own sake, and material wealth or earthly pleasures were seen as distractions from truth. Bellmead was a quiet, solemn place during this time, more like a monastery than a school.

- **Key Themes**: Asceticism, humility, the pursuit of pure knowledge, the tension between spiritual and intellectual fulfillment.    
  
- **Tone**: Reflective, solemn, with an undertone of quiet obsession—knowledge is revered as a sacred act, but the thirst for it begins to show its dangerous edge.
  
- **Characters**:
	- **[[Abbot Silvanus]]**: A wise and deeply ascetic leader who viewed the Abbey’s role as one of **stewardship** over the natural resources of the land. His philosophy was that the **purity of the [[Underground Lake]]** was a divine gift that should be shared with all, reflecting the **selfless nature** of Annealed. Under his guidance, the monks lived modestly, focusing on **prayer, education, and the well-being** of the surrounding people.
    
	- **[[Archcleric Theodric]]**: A leader who emphasized **education and knowledge** as acts of devotion. Theodric viewed the Abbey not just as a place of worship, but as a **repository of wisdom**, where the divine was reflected in the study of both spiritual and earthly matters. The construction of the aqueduct under his leadership would symbolize the Abbey’s desire to **extend the grace** of Annealed beyond the walls, benefiting the people of Tor through both physical and spiritual sustenance.
	  
	- **[[Sister Evelynn]], Keeper of the Texts**, one of the earliest scholars at Bellmead. She exemplifies the cloister’s ascetic values, believing that knowledge must be earned through sacrifice. Evelynn was a figure of wisdom, but her devotion to Annealed led her to make increasingly difficult choices in the pursuit of knowledge.    

#### Key Details/Events
- **Early Simplicity**: The Annealed Abbey, with its ascetics living in seclusion, could have originally been seen as a place of purity and spiritual enlightenment. The sparse lifestyle, reliant on the lake and local flora, reinforced their strict devotion to the God of Austerity. Their isolation created an aura of mystique and divine favor, and villagers might have viewed them with reverence, awe, and fear.
  
- **The Rope Bridge**: The rickety rope bridge, connecting the Abbey to the outside world, symbolizes their tenuous connection to the mundane world. It’s a liminal space, and perhaps those who crossed it were said to undergo spiritual transformation, rarely returning to their previous lives. This bridge could be a recurring symbol of transition and isolation.
  
- **Silence from the Abbey**: The lack of communication from the monks, who only occasionally descended to Tor, adds to the Abbey’s mysterious nature. Villagers could spin stories about the monks being in communion with their God or that the monks had transcended into something beyond human. This period might be marked by a sacred silence that slowly begins to break when Danaus arrives.

- **Construction of the Aqueduct**
	* The **aqueduct** built during this era was simple but effective. It represented the Abbey’s desire to **share the lake’s purity** with the people of Tor and beyond, symbolizing their **duty of care** for those outside their secluded order. The monks likely saw the **water from the underground lake** as holy, and the aqueduct was not just a feat of engineering but also a **sacred project**.

	- **A Symbol of Purity and Service**: The aqueduct would have been built using the simplest materials available to the monks, in keeping with the values of Annealed. While rudimentary by later standards, it was a marvel of cooperation between the monks and the villagers. The act of sharing the water was seen as a **sacred duty**, with the underground lake being viewed as a **source of divine purity**.
    
	- **A Unifying Effort**: The construction of the aqueduct may have been a collaborative effort between the monks and the people of **Tor**, reflecting the unity between the Abbey and the outside world during this era. This cooperation would have strengthened the bond between the Abbey and the village, symbolizing the **monks’ humility and devotion** to the well-being of all.
