NOTES that need reconciliation/refinement.

In this region there is a strange landmass: two peaks side by side made of wholly different materials. There are two peaks, one made of common land and its counterpart is the [[The Batholith]]. Like twin mountain tops, with a spurious rope bridge between them, until the [[The Great Bridge]] is built.
