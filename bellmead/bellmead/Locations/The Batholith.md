### The Batholith’s Physical Presence

- Ancient and Imposing: The sheer scale of the batholith gives Bellmead a fortress-like presence, with towering cliffs and jagged rocks. The school feels near impenetrable from the outside, sitting atop this massive geological formation. 
  
- Geological Features: The surface of the batholith began as scarred, with strange formations that resemble bones or fossilized remains. Over time these were stripped down or hewn into pathways, dwellings, and even statues. Some sections of rock glow faintly at night, or hum with an inaudible frequency, causing unease and fueling rumors about the true nature of the Batholith.
  
- Natural Defenses: The batholith itself has steep sides or cliffs, making it difficult to access. There is a natural landmass that leads up to it and there is a canyon between it and the Batholith. The crossing has changed over the eras, once a simple and dangerous rope bridge that was later replaced by [[The Aqueduct]] and  eventually the [[The Great Bridge]].
  
- Isolation: The goings on within Bellmead are unknown to outsiders thus idle speculation has evolved into rumors ranging from the mundane to the bizarre. 

### The Tunnels and Catacombs

- The Labyrinth Below: Beneath the school lies a labyrinth of tunnels, catacombs, and forgotten chambers. These serve as both a literal and metaphorical descent into the unknown. Some tunnels are man-made, constructed by the early scholars of Bellmead, while others seem to predate human history. Several have journeyed deep into those places hoping to discover an ancient presence. Some intrepid explorers returned with truly awesome and terrible discoveries while others never returned at all.
  
- Purpose and Use: The origins and purpose of the Tunnels is unknown, though many theories exist. A popular ghost story was it was the innards of a Cosmic God. Through the eras, they were used for anything from storage (of goods, the deceased, secrets), to rituals, to scholarly experimentation. Over time, many sections have collapsed, become overgrown with strange fungi, or filled with stagnant pools of water. Some tunnels still lead to forgotten libraries or ancient relics, while others end abruptly, as though intentionally sealed off. It is difficult to tell now what is original and what has been carved out.
  
- The Catacombs: A section of the underground complex served as a burial site for former students and faculty. However, in the deeper levels, there can be found the dark secrets and remnants of early experiments and arcane rituals. The further one ventures, the more unnatural the architecture becomes—walls made of black stone, or tunnels lined with cryptic symbols. It lead people to have strange thoughts and even go mad. Eventually the catacombs became a forbidden place due to these strange goings on, but [[Ix]] reopened them to further his research.

### Remains of a Cosmic God
 A persistent myth among the students and faculty, is that the Batholith is the remains of a Cosmic God. This story has passed down through generations but never fully acknowledged. Only the most devout or mad scholars truly believe it. There is subtle evidence throughout the catacombs that give credence to this theory—massive bone-like structures deep within the tunnels as well as areas where the rock seems almost organic in nature. Some chambers hum with a strange energy, making those who linger too long feel lightheaded or feverish. There are early reports claiming the rock would “bleed” a black ichor when chipped away, but they are few and unsubstantiated.

 A small sect within Bellmead secretly adopted the belief of the Batholith's divinity and worship its remains. They performed rituals deep in the tunnels, attempting to commune with the entity they believe slumbers within. 
   
### The Art of Memory
see [[Art of Memory]]
Some believe The Art of Memory came from deep within the Batholith. Be it from the [[Underground Lake]] or it is an extension of the remains of the a Cosmic God.
### Through the Eras
- Era of [[Annealed]]: In this era, the tunnels were largely used as quiet places of meditation, and contemplation. Before the Abbey was fully constructed novices lived there. ==How do we tie in the God of Austerity? something about the batholith’s perceived sacredness? the early scholars may have seen it as a symbol of their own intellectual purity.==
  
- Era of [[Anweald]]: In contrast, during the Era of Anweald, the tunnels were be repurposed for more rigid, secretive uses. They house interrogation chambers and disciplinary cells, secret libraries of forbidden knowledge, or be used for experiments conducted away from the prying eyes of students. This is some of the stuff [[Donal the Strange]] found. The God of Authority’s influence should cast a darker shadow over the batholith, turning what was once a place of quiet reflection into a fortress of control.
