A wise and deeply ascetic leader who viewed the Abbeyâ€™s role as one of **stewardship** over the natural resources of the land. His philosophy was that the **purity of the [[Underground Lake]]** was a divine gift that should be shared with all, reflecting the **selfless nature** of Annealed. Under his guidance, the monks lived modestly, focusing on **prayer, education, and the well-being** of the surrounding people.
