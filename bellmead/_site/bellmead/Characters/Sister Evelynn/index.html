<p>a.k.a. <strong>Keeper of the Texts</strong>
One of the earliest scholars at Bellmead. She exemplifies the cloister’s ascetic values, believing that knowledge must be earned through sacrifice. Evelynn was a figure of wisdom, but her devotion to Annealed led her to make increasingly difficult choices in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>Evelynn was the first to discover [[Art of Memory]], though she did not realize it.</p>
<p>Evelynn’s brilliance is matched only by her strict adherence to austerity. She becomes obsessed with uncovering a series of ancient texts that detail the hidden truths of the cosmos. Her journey symbolizes the tension between the strictness of the cloister and the insatiable hunger for knowledge. As she uncovers more, she begins to blur the line between holy devotion and her own intellectual pride.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong>: Evelynn’s discoveries form the foundation of Bellmead’s early knowledge, but her later life is shrouded in mystery. Some say she ascended to a higher plane of consciousness; others believe she was consumed by the very knowledge she sought.</p>
