<p>Legends of the Lake: Legends about the lake abound among the scholars and students. Some believe it to be a portal to other dimensions or realms, while others claim that creatures or entities dwell beneath its dark waters.

Initially this was shared altruistically, but later controlled, and later still deemed to be dangerous and volatile. It may aid with the portals. It may be the origin of the [[Art of Memory]].</p>
