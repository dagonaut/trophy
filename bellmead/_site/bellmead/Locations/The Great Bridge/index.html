NOTE: Initial inspiration of the bridge. This will need more development.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Built atop the [[The Aqueduct]] as a replacement for the rope bridge marked a paradigm shift from a simple means of travel to a symbol of what the Abbey now represented.</p>
<h3>Properties and Symbols</h3>
<ul>
<li>Symbol of Transition: The great bridge leading to Bellmead is a deliberate symbol. What started as a controlled gateway turned into a representation of a journey, both physical and intellectual, from the ordinary world to the extraordinary. Crossing the bridge acted as a rite of passage for students, scholars, and visitors alike, signifying their entrance into a world of hidden knowledge and ancient mysteries.</li>
<li>Perilous Journey: The bridge itself is vast and imposing, suspended high above the ground, creating a sense of awe and danger for those crossing it. The wind howls as one traverses the bridge, and mist rises from the depths below, obscuring the view. The bridge might also be known for strange phenomenaâ€”disorienting fogs, visions of the past or future, or odd sensations of being watched.</li>
<li>Guardians or Secrets: Through the eras the accoutrements of the bridge evolved from statues and carvings that line the bridge to ancient sentinels that are said to guard the entrance to Bellmead. The statues change over the years, initially it was symbols of austerity then later they resemble strange, otherworldly beings, hinting at the cosmic nature of the batholith. Legends suggest that certain figures never complete the crossing, disappearing into the mist or reappearing at random.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Through the Eras</h3>
<ul>
<li>The bridge was built during the era of [[Anweald]] as a symbol of strength and prosperity. It illustrated the Abbey's control over who entered and exited the compound.</li>
<li>Donal made of a point of making the bridge a place of celebration, a gateway into Bellmead. He wanted to show they had nothing to hide and their knowledge was available to all.</li>
</ul>
