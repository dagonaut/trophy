<h1>Bellmead Project - Notes and World Building</h1>
<h2>1. General Overview</h2>
<p>Bellmead is a school modeled after Byrgenwerth (inspired by Bloodborne), serving as the focal point for various stories and eras. The tone and style of the world is consistent, with slight variations across different eras.</p>
<h2>2. Eras and Historical Timeline</h2>
<h3>Era of Annealed (God of Austerity)</h3>
<ul>
<li>This era marks Bellmead's origin as a cloister focused on education and austerity.</li>
<li>The aqueduct was built during this era to share the purity of the underground lake with the people of <strong>Tor</strong> and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Claus</strong>, the leader of the Abbey, took his vows and adopted his name to symbolize service and purity.</li>
<li>Claus led the construction of the aqueduct as a gesture of humility and communal care.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Era of Anweald (God of Authority)</h3>
<ul>
<li>This era saw a shift toward discipline and dogmatic practices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Great Bridge</strong> was built above the aqueduct during this era.</li>
<li><strong>Danaus Doorn</strong> eventually dammed the aqueduct during his rule, turning it into a tool of control, withholding water from the people of <strong>Tor</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Era of Donal the Strange</h3>
<ul>
<li>Donal, once a pupil of the Abbey, grew frustrated with its corruption and led a revolt against its clerics.</li>
<li>Bellmead was built upon the ashes of the Abbey.</li>
<li><strong>The Art of Memory</strong> became central, originally in its untainted form but later twisted.</li>
<li>Donal’s pupil <strong>Ix</strong> discovered how to manipulate the portals and led to the corruption of Bellmead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Post-Ix Era</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bellmead has collapsed, with treasure hunters like <strong>Martin</strong> exploring the ruins in search of personal stakes.</li>
<li>The <strong>dragon skeleton</strong> on the Great Bridge is a key feature, with rumors that <strong>Bea</strong> died fighting it, though she may still protect the ruins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Themes and Concepts</h2>
<h3>The Art of Memory</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Art of Memory</strong> was originally a tool for preserving knowledge, history, and truth in an untainted form.</li>
<li>It became corrupted over time, and <strong>Ix</strong> twisted it for control and manipulation, leading to Bellmead’s collapse.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Great Bridge</h3>
<ul>
<li>Built during the <strong>Era of Anweald</strong> over the aqueduct, it became a symbol of Bellmead's authority.</li>
<li>The bridge eventually collapsed, and a dragon's skeleton now lies upon it, a key element of the post-Ix ruins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Other Elements</h2>
<ul>
