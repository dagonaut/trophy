<p>Length: Decades</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Era Overview:</strong> Following the cloister’s initial intellectual flowering, what would later be  Bellmead transforms into a highly disciplined, dogmatic institution under the influence of the God of Authority, Anweald. The school becomes a strict, almost militaristic academy where knowledge is no longer pursued for personal enlightenment but to reinforce the rigid structures of power and authority. Anweald’s presence casts a shadow over the school, turning it into a place where control, discipline, and rigid hierarchy reign supreme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Themes:</strong> Authority, discipline, the subjugation of knowledge to power, the tension between control and freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tone:</strong> Oppressive, regimented, and foreboding. The school's atmosphere becomes colder, with a focus on conformity, and individuality is suppressed for the “greater good” of the institution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paradigm Shift: [[Danaus Doorn]]’s arrival in [[Tor]] is a moment of profound change. While he also worships Anweald, his interpretation of the god’s role focuses on Authority rather than Austerity. He initially gains favor by providing some form of stability or protection, but his true intentions—control—soon become apparent. The damming of the lake and demanding tribute from the village would mark a stark contrast to the previous monks’ isolated lifestyle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transformation of the Abbey: Under Danaus, the Abbey undergoes a dramatic shift, from a place of sparse devotion to a center of power. The labor of the novices from Tor, building the great bridge and improvements to the aqueduct, mark the beginning of Bellmead's transformation into an imposing, more worldly institution. The simple rickety rope bridge is replaced by a grander, more solid bridge, symbolizing the Abbey’s shift from spiritual seclusion to a more authoritarian and visible force.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploitation of Novices: Danaus's use of children for labor subtly introduces the darker practices that will define the Abbey’s future. The villagers’ children are no longer just novices learning spiritual truths—they are pawns in a growing power structure. This also introduces the notion of innocence being corrupted by the pursuit of power, which will play out in later eras.</p>

<h3>Aetolos and the Discovery Beneath the Monolith</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mineral Discovery: The finding of an unknown mineral deep within the monolith by [[Aetolos]] signals the beginning of the Abbey’s descent into something far darker. This mineral could have properties tied to the batholith’s rumored cosmic origins, possibly glowing faintly or reacting in strange ways to light or sound. The mineral might be a link between the physical world and the cosmic entities beneath, representing a literal connection to the forces Anweald is said to embody.</li>
<li>Communion with Unknown Entities: Aetolos’s communion with previously unknown entities suggests a broader cosmology beyond Anweald, which could imply that the god is part of a pantheon of cosmic forces—or perhaps something entirely different. His discovery might lead to strange rituals being conducted in secret chambers beneath the Abbey, with the lake and the tunnels playing a central role.</li>
<li>Behavioral Changes: The Abbey’s increasingly strange behavior—taking more children, including girls—marks a deepening corruption. The justification that they are being taught divine knowledge could be a cover for something much more sinister, perhaps preparing them to serve as vessels or channels for the entities that Aetolos communes with. This era begins the Abbey's transformation into a place not just of religious devotion but of cosmic experimentation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Rise of the Cathedral</h4>
<p>The opulent transformation of the Abbey into a cathedral with towers and the expansion into the monolith reflect a shift from humility to grandeur. The towers could be symbolic of the Abbey’s attempt to reach the heavens or transcend the limits of human knowledge, while the further digging into the monolith represents their descent into darker, more dangerous mysteries.</p>
<h4>Key Events and Details</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Building of the Bridge</li>
<li>The Building of the Cathedral</li>
<li>The discoveries in the depths</li>
<li>Aetolos discovery</li>
<li>The exploitation of the villagers (children)</li>
<li>The arrival and revolution of Donal</li>
</ul>
<h4>Questions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is Danaus still there when Donal arrives? Who is in charge?</li>
<li>Is there an inherent denial of the supernatural during this era? Is that what Donal exposes? I think so. Donal's era brings in &quot;magic&quot; separate from the &quot;divine&quot;.</li>
