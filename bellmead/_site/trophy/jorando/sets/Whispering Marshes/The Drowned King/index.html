<h4>Description:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Once a noble ruler of Kalduhr, the Drowned King came to Jorando to atone for his sins, but it was too late and he was cursed by the gods for his hubris and now wanders the marshes, his body bloated and twisted by the waters that claimed his life. His body is bloated and twisted, adorned in tattered, waterlogged finery. His crown, a symbol of lost glory, is rusted and fused to his skull. He drags a massive sword covered in Marrow Cling that seems impossibly heavy, but he wields it with terrifying ease. His eyes glow with a sickly green light, and the air around him is filled with the stench of decay.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lore:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Legends tell of the Drowned King’s hubris during the <strong>Sundering</strong>. Seeking forbidden power, he attempted a ritual that failed catastrophically, binding him to the marsh as a tragic, cursed figure. His presence is said to ensure no one disturbs the dark secrets buried in the heart of the marsh.</li>
</ul>

<p>Special: <strong>Corrosive Breath</strong> – He exhales a cloud of toxic mist that corrodes armor and weapons, reducing their effectiveness. Players must cleanse themselves with an antidote or suffer ongoing damage.</p>
