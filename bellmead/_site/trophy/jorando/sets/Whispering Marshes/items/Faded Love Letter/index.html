<p><em>A yellowed piece of parchment folded many times over, the ink faded but still legible in soft light.

<p><em>My Dearest Liora,</em></p>
<p>The nights grow colder without you by my side, and the shadows in this cursed village grow longer with each passing day. I fear what they say about the lake, but my love for you burns brighter than any fear in my heart.</p>
<p>Meet me where the sun once kissed the stone, where the ivy now hides what we once held dear. Beneath the old bell tower, where our vows were whispered to the winds, I have left something for youâ€”something to remember me by, should the darkness take us both.</p>
<p>Follow the path we walked that autumn day, when the leaves were golden and the world was ours. Iâ€™ll wait for you there, in the place where we promised forever.</p>
<p><em>Yours,</em><br>

<p><strong>Quote:</strong><br>
<em>&quot;Itâ€™s just a letterâ€¦ unless you know where to read it.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong><br>
Reveals the location of a hidden compartment beneath the Bell Tower. The compartment contains the <strong>Silver Locket of Eternal Vows</strong> and a hidden mural scratched into the stoneâ€”an old diagram showing the <strong>Reclamation Ritual</strong>, suggesting it was more than legend. The mural includes a faded symbol matching one carved into the Sentinelâ€™s cracked core.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”— Suggested Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Faded Love Letter</strong> leads players to the <strong>Silver Locket</strong>, acting as a key or trigger object for a larger ritual or memory mechanic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Locket</strong> grants spiritual resistance and may allow players to see glimpses of what happened at the Reclamation site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The letter also establishes a <strong>personal</strong> emotional anchor between <strong>Alaric and Liora</strong>, grounding the larger mystery of the Reclamation in human loss and love.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like me to card the letter (and later the locket) in a narrative-focused format? Or would you prefer this shown via an in-world document visual first?</p>
<p>old:
A letter written by a villager to a lost loved one. Reading it fills the reader with sorrow but reveals a hidden location within the village.</p>
<p>Mechanic: Reveals the location of some cool shit and some lore.</p>
