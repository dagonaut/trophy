<p><em>A lantern filled with glowing moss that thrives in the marshes. It provides dim light and can be used to reveal hidden paths, but the glow attracts creatures of the swamp.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Keep it lit, traveler—but don’t let the glow fool you. In the marsh, what sees you is worse than what you see.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Its light cannot be hidden, nor can it hide.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Can find hidden paths/treasure (when in use, allows treasure to be found even on failure)</p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> When combined with the [[Priests Jaw Bone]] it weakens the defense of the Drowned King (-4).</p>
