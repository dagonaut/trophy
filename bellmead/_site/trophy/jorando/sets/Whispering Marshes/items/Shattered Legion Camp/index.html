<p>Tucked into the northern edge of the village, where the homes give way to twisted brambles and broken stone, lies a makeshift encampment built from torn banners, rusted weapons, and the bones of those who came before. Once soldiers in service of a forgotten cause, the Shattered Legion now squat in the ruins like carrion birds. Their armor is cracked, their minds splintered, and their loyalty twisted into something monstrous. The camp smells of oil, blood, and old grief.</p>
<p><strong>Trap / Hazard / Encounter:</strong><br>
The camp is surrounded by brittle tripwires made from sinew and bell chimes. Entering without care alerts the Legion’s remnants—gaunt, half-armored soldiers who still march in broken formations. They do not speak but follow commands barked by a skeletal captain who drills them from a burning brazier in the center of camp. Once combat begins, their coordination is eerie and unnerving.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combat:</strong> Moderate to high difficulty — at least 4 Legionaries and 1 Elite Commander.</li>
<li><strong>Special Danger:</strong> Legionaries fight in pairs, using synchronized attacks. Killing one enrages the other. The Commander can call reinforcements once during the battle unless his brazier is extinguished.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Threat:</strong> The brazier can explode if tampered with, dealing fire damage and summoning a ghostly horn blast that draws distant spirits from other parts of the village.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing:</strong><br>
Among the detritus of discipline gone to rot are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blacksteel Flanged Mace</strong> – Forged long ago, this mace strikes with precision and weight. On a critical strike, it knocks enemies prone. Still warm to the touch.</li>
<li><strong>Requisition Ledger</strong> – A brittle book with orders, names, and locations. When cross-referenced with clues from the Crumbling Diary or Faded Letter, it reveals the route to a hidden weapons cache buried under a ruined outpost east of the village.</li>
<li><strong>Phantom Commander's Sigil</strong> – A pendant once worn by the Legion's captain. When invoked during a moment of fear, it summons ghostly Legionnaires to fight by your side (1 black die in combat) —but it costs 1 Ruin? as its echo feeds off your resolve.</li>
</ul>
