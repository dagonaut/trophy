<em>A gnarled staff made from the wood of ancient, waterlogged trees. It grants the user increased control over water-based magic but is fragile and prone to breaking.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Handle it with careâ€”once broken, its magic will flow away like the tide.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Adds 1 white die to Ritual rolls. Lost if Ruin is taken.</p>
