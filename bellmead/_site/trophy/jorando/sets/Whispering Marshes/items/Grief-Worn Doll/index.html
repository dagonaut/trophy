<p><em>A small,. hand-stitched doll, its linen body darkened with age and sorrow. Tufts of hair cling to the cracked scalp, and its glass eyes, one chipped, glisten with a mournful glint. The stitching along its chest is crude—as if someone tried to sew a broken heart back into place.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;She cried every night until the doll cried back.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;After she stopped crying, the doll cried for her&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong><br>
While held, the doll grants <strong>visions of the village’s final days</strong>, allowing the player to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Spout Lore</span> on any haunt, spirit, or ruin in Evershade. Once used, the doll begins whispering in the voice of a child during moments of rest, imposing a minor penalty unless it is willingly left behind.</p>
