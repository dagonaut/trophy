<p><em>A crumbling lower jawbone, etched with half-erased prayers and wrapped in the remnants of a cleric’s burial cloth. When gripped, it whispers liturgies in a dead tongue—calming to some, maddening to others.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;He spoke of salvation until the end. Now, his silence speaks louder.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Once per session, grants immunity to fear or compels a nearby spirit to answer one question truthfully. May cause 1 Ruin if overused.</p>
<p>Hints to combine with [[Glowmoss Lantern]]:
<em>&quot;When the dead preach by borrowed light, the king shall remember his guilt.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;Bind the tongue of the fallen priest to the lantern’s glow, and drown not—but be heard.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;Only by lighting the forgotten sermon can his sorrow take form.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;The light alone he fears, but give it a voice, and he will tremble.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;What was said in death must be shown in light. Only then will the drowned turn their gaze.&quot;</em></p>
