<p><em>A decayed leather-bound journal with brittle pages and water-damaged ink. The entries begin mundane—farm yields, family names—before spiraling into fragmented warnings and pleas scratched in haste.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The well… the bells won’t stop… I saw the stone move. Gods forgive me, I looked inside.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong><br>
Spout Lore. The diary reveals secrets about the Weeping Well, the Stone Sentinel, and the Reclamation puzzle.</p>
<p>Other Quotes:
<strong>Option 1 (unraveling mind):</strong><br>
<em>&quot;I thought writing it down would help me remember. But now the words change when I’m not looking.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Option 2 (haunted guilt):</strong><br>
<em>&quot;They begged me not to go near the well. I told them I wouldn’t. I lied.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Option 3 (ominous foresight):</strong><br>
<em>&quot;Something is clawing its way up. And we keep digging.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Option 4 (resigned dread):</strong><br>
<em>&quot;It doesn’t matter what we write. The ink runs. The pages rot. The end always finds us.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Stone Sentinel</strong>:
“...we tried everything—blade, fire, blessed ash. Nothing broke its stride.<br>
But then old Reth swung wild and low—his hammer cracked it just <em>so</em>.<br>
A flicker in the chest, a pulse like light under moss...<br>
It staggered.</p>
<p>Only then did we see it wasn’t invincible—just stubborn.</p>
<p>The crack isn’t always there. But when it <em>opens</em>—like a breath drawn in stone—<br>
strike not with anger, but with timing.”</p>
