<em>A rusted, wind-up music box etched with a cracked heart inside its lid. The melody it plays is faint and uneven—like a memory trying to remember itself.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;It only plays when no one is listening. That’s when she hears it.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong><br>
Plays a sorrowful tune that soothes restless spirits. Use to abate the spirit in the Weeping Well.</p>
