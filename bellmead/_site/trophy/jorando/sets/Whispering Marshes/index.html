<p><em>The Whispering Marshes sprawl with unnatural stillness, where the air is thick with fog and sorrow. Once a fertile expanse, the land now chokes on brackish water and creeping vines. The fog whispers secrets—some true, some unkind—feeding on the grief of any who linger. It is a place of transition, between the realms of the living and the dead, between memory and forgetting.</em></p>
<p><em>Travelers avoid the marshes, claiming that those who enter often forget why they came—or who they were. Strange flowers bloom in silence, and the mud seems to suck at boots with a mind of its own. It is said the dead rise here not out of vengeance, but confusion, trying to finish lives long faded.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a place where sorrows echo.</em></p>
<p>The Whispering Marshes are a vast expanse of mist-covered wetlands surrounding the approach to [[Evershade]]. The ground is soft and treacherous, with twisted trees rising from the murky waters, their roots exposed like grasping fingers. The air is thick with fog and the distant sound of whispered voices, barely discernible and impossible to locate. These whispers seem to come from all directions, filling the players with a sense of unease and foreboding.</p>
