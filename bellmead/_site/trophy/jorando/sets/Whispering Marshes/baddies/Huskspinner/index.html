<p><strong>Grotesque Marsh Insect – CR 7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong>
A bloated, carapaced insect the size of a hound, its back split open into a nest of writhing feelers and twitching legs. Milky, lidless eyes scan ceaselessly, and its mandibles drip with reeking bile. Its belly is translucent, revealing smaller larvae pulsing within.</p>
<p><strong>Abilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web-Egg Bomb:</strong> Launches a sac that bursts into acidic webs; immobilizes and burns armor/flesh.</li>
<li><strong>Piercing Mandibles:</strong> Injects numbing venom; untreated wounds may hatch larvae.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Vulnerable to fire; softens under sustained heat.</p>
