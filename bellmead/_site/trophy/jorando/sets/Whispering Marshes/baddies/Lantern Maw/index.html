<p>Wraith - CR 6</p>
<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong>
A bloated, semi-transparent swamp wraith with a glowing moss-lantern fused into its chest. Its face is stretched into a permanent scream, and spectral limbs drift in and out of its shifting form like trailing smoke.</p>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong>
The Lantern Maw is bound to light—strong sources of fire or focused light briefly banish its limbs, making it vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p><strong>Attacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glowlash</strong> – The Lantern Maw whips a luminous tendril of mosslight toward a target. On hit, it wraps around the victim’s eyes and mouth, blinding and silencing them.</li>
<li><strong>Swallowing Gloom</strong> – The creature lets out a pulse of shadow that snuffs out all light sources nearby and pulls victims 10 feet closer, leaving them disoriented.</li>
</ul>
