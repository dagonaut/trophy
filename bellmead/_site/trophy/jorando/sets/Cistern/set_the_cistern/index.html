<p><strong>SET: THE CISTERN BENEATH THE RUINED CHURCH OF THE HOLLOWED SAINTS</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3>üìú Intro</h3>
<p>Beneath the cracked stone floors of the Ruined Church lies the cistern: a once-holy chamber now drowned in sanctified corruption. Carved into the earth as a reservoir for sacred water, the cistern was once blessed by the Hollowed Saints themselves. Pilgrims would descend to draw healing waters, believed to protect against grief and disease. But with the taint of the Lake of Tears, that purity twisted. The water grew still, heavy with sorrow. Saints wept into the pool, and their despair rooted into the stone. Now the cistern reflects not grace, but grief, a mirror to the fall of faith.</p>
