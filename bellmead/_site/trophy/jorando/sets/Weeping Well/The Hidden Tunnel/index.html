<p>The stone seal grinds open into a narrow passage, just wide enough to squeeze through sideways. The tunnel is low and damp, carved by ancient hands and reshaped by centuries of grief and rot. Walls weep moisture. The air is foul and warm, carrying the sour reek of decay. Shapes are carved into the walls‚Äîfaceless figures hunched in agony, reaching toward each other but never quite touching. When you walk, your footsteps echo‚Äîbut not always in time.</p>
<p>The tunnel feels alive. It remembers.</p>

<h3>üé≠ Paint the Scene</h3>
<p>Ask the players:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What do you brush against in the dark that makes you recoil?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What part of your body starts to ache, as though bearing an old injury?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What whispered word do you hear, and who once said it to you?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Hazards &amp; Effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Claustrophobia Pulse</strong>: The longer one stays in the tunnel, the heavier the air becomes.<br>
<em>Effect</em>: Roll Resolve or Willpower every 10‚Äì15 minutes. Failure causes a creeping sense of despair, loss of clarity, or gain of 1 Burden or Ruin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memory Echo</strong>:<br>
When a player speaks, there‚Äôs a 1-in-6 chance their own voice speaks back‚Äîaccusing them of a failure, lie, or regret.<br>
<em>Effect</em>: Disadvantage on the next roll unless another character intervenes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slick Collapse Points</strong>:<br>
A portion of the tunnel has partially caved in. Players must crawl through, triggering tight-squeeze panic.<br>
<em>Effect</em>: One item may be lost (die reroll). Also, roll or narrate how the tunnel ‚Äòtests‚Äô you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>üß≥ Secrets &amp; Interactions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Names on the Walls</strong>: Some of the carvings bear ancient names, but if a player has confessed sorrow earlier, one of the names morphs to reflect someone <em>they</em> lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grief Pools</strong>: Shallow puddles shimmer with a mirror-like surface.<br>
Looking in shows a warped, tragic version of the onlooker's face. If touched, the pool whispers a secret of someone nearby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sobbing Vein</strong>: A fissure in the wall leaks dark water that sobs with each drop. If bottled in the <strong>Tearcatch Flask</strong>, it can be used to empower or silence a ghost.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>üß≠ Navigation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Side Passage (1-in-6 chance to notice)</strong> leads to the <strong>Forgotten Chamber</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Main Tunnel</strong> leads toward the <strong>Gate of Names</strong> and the <strong>Cistern</strong> beyond.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Transition Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Behind</strong>: Return to the Tunnel Entrance. The door may now be harder to pass‚Äîone player hears it whisper, ‚ÄúYou left something behind.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ahead</strong>: Reach the <strong>Forgotten Chamber</strong> or continue toward the <strong>Gate of Names</strong> in the <strong>Weeping Well‚Äôs inner sanctum</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
