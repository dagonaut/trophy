<p><em>There is a place beneath Evershade where grief has pooled for centuries‚Äîa place unspoken, yet known. The Weeping Well is older than the village above, its stones eroded smooth by tears and time. A vine-choked ladder leads down into shadow and stillness, past slick stone and votive carvings barely visible under moss. At the bottom: silence, broken only by the drip of water and the sigh of something remembering.</em></p>
<p>The faithful once came here to cast away sorrow, but the sorrow clung. It soaked into the stone and wept back. Now, forgotten relics rot beside fetid water, and something stirs within‚Äîa watcher of grief, the Seer of the Well. And deeper still lies a path nearly forgotten‚Äîone taken by only the most desperate or damned. The Hidden Tunnel connects this place to the Cistern beneath the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints.</p>

<h3>Locations / Traps / Opportunities:</h3>
<h5>The Well Shaft</h5>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
The descent into the Weeping Well begins at a vine-choked ring of stone, nearly swallowed by the ruins of Evershade. A rusted iron ladder vanishes into darkness. Each rung bears a name‚Äîsome carved with reverence, others violently scratched out. The air grows colder with every step, thick with the scent of wet stone and faded incense. The only sound is water dripping‚Ä¶ from somewhere far below, or perhaps from your own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The walls sweat with moisture that smells faintly of salt and sorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glowing lichen reveals old votive markings: saints with erased faces, names no longer remembered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sob echoes faintly‚Äîand no one will admit to making it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>üé≠ Paint the Scene</h3>
<p>Ask the players:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What name do you find carved on the rung just below your hand‚Äîand why does it hurt to see it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What object on your person suddenly feels <em>heavier</em> as you descend, as though burdened by memory?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What sound from below reminds you of someone you lost?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Traps / Hazards</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Grief-Strained Rung</strong>: If any character spoke aloud about a past grief in the village above, one rung will crumble beneath their weight. The fall isn‚Äôt deadly, but it jostles everyone and may alert something waiting below.<br>
<em>Effect</em>: Risk roll to avoid slipping, or take a Burden (psychic shock, twisted ankle, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Watching Name</strong>: One rung is freshly carved with a party member‚Äôs name‚Äîone they haven‚Äôt told the others.<br>
<em>Effect</em>: Sanity check or Ruin gain if confronted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>ü™û Secrets &amp; Interactions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Touching a Carving</strong>: If a character traces one of the names with their finger and speaks a memory aloud, they are briefly surrounded by warmth and whispering light. Gain a white die on the next Willpower roll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Votive Symbol</strong>: One of the symbols glows when someone cries‚Äîthis may be used to reveal a hidden message or clue about the <strong>Gate of Names</strong> later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>üß≥ Treasures / Clues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rope of Names</strong> (on a hook halfway down):<br>
<em>A knotted rope once used in sacred rites. Each knot is etched with a name.</em><br>
<em>Mechanic</em>: Escape one fall. When used, hear a whisper of who tied each knot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tearcatch Flask</strong> (tucked into a crevice):<br>
<em>Fills when grief is nearby. Can be used as holy water.</em><br>
<em>Quote</em>: ‚ÄúGrief sanctified is still grief.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inscription Shard</strong>:<br>
<em>Broken piece of stone with half a confession etched into it. The rest may be found in the <strong>Mirror Pool</strong> or the <strong>Cistern</strong>.</em><br>
<em>Mechanic</em>: Acts as a key for the Gate of Names, but costs 1 Ruin when invoked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>üîÑ Transitions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Downward</strong>: Continue into the <strong>Tunnel Entrance</strong>‚Äîa narrow opening veiled with moss, guarded by ancient runes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upward</strong>: Return to <strong>Evershade</strong>, but something may now follow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Would you like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flesh out <strong>The Tunnel Entrance</strong> next?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a visual <strong>map node</strong> or <strong>pixel image prompt</strong> for The Well Shaft?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design a <strong>haunting encounter</strong> mid-descent (e.g., a Wailbound spirit, a vision, or puzzle)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know where to focus!</p>
<p><strong>The Tunnel Entrance</strong>
Hidden beneath the well, marked by ancient runes that glow faintly with cursed energy.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Trap</em>: Opening the tunnel without understanding the runes triggers a psychic scream.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Hidden Tunnel</strong>
A dark, damp passage connecting the Weeping Well to the cistern beneath the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints. The walls are slick with moisture, and the air is thick with the stench of decay and the echo of distant weeping. The path is narrow and treacherous, with many places where the walls seem to close in.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Treasure</em>: The Mourner‚Äôs Signet (see Items)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Forgotten Chamber</strong>
A small, secret room branching off the tunnel. Used long ago by Hollowed Saints for forbidden rites. Its walls are lined with crumbling books, rusted ritual implements, and an altar that glows faintly with lingering corruption.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Treasure</em>: Dust-Covered Manuscript (usable once for a forbidden miracle or spell), Blood-Slicked Censer (draws Wailbound closer when swung)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Boss:</h3>
<h4>Seer of the Well</h4>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The Seer was once a prophetess who could see the future, but the power of the well twisted her visions into nightmares. Now, she is a spectral figure who haunts the well, her eyes hollow and her mouth sewn shut to prevent her from speaking the horrors she has seen. Her presence causes the waters of the well to ripple with dark energy, and her very touch can show a person their darkest future.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot see you if you show no sorrow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Echoes of the Past</strong> ‚Äì The Seer can be weakened by playing an ancient melody that was once sung in the village. Players must find a way to reproduce this melody to disrupt her powers. [[Broken Music Box]]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abilities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Causes visions of past grief. Absorbs spoken confessions to empower itself.</li>
<li><strong>Curse of Silence</strong>¬†‚Äì The Seer can curse a player, rendering them unable to speak or cast spells. This curse can only be lifted by defeating her or using a rare item found in the well (Mourner's Signet).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Forbidden Miracles (d6):</strong></p>
<ol>

<h3>Moments of Light</h3>
<h3>Way Forward</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>To The Cistern</strong> via Hidden Tunnel.</li>
<li><strong>Back to Evershade</strong> via the well shaft.</li>
<li><strong>Subversion</strong>: Offering a true confession at the shrine opens a faster, safer route to the Cistern.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crossing the Threshold</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Gate of Names</strong> ‚Äì Whisper a name you've never spoken aloud. Learned via a moss-runed stone (‚ÄúWhat you do not say binds you still‚Äù) or a scrawled page in the Dust-Covered Manuscript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúTo pass, you must give what time would take. The forgotten are the price of passage.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Turning of the Wheel</strong> ‚Äì Two must rotate the rusted mechanism in harmony. Discovered via a hymnbook note or visualized using the Candle of Remorse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúTheir hands built the wheel. Their regrets turn it still.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Mirror Pool</strong> ‚Äì Each adventurer must voice a regret. Hinted by a phrase on the Mourner‚Äôs Signet or a whisper from the Seer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúThe mask bears no judgment. Only the reflection does.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Drowned Choir</strong> ‚Äì Harmonize vocally or ritually with submerged statues. Foreshadowed in a crumbling hymnbook or activated by the Blood-Slicked Censer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúWhen we sang, the sorrow parted. When we stopped, it returned.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
