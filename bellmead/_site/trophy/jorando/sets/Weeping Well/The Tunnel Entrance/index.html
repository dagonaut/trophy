<p>At the bottom of the shaft, where the ladder ends in darkness and dripping silence, lies a narrow arch of stone, nearly swallowed by roots and runes. The <strong>Tunnel Entrance</strong> is slick with condensation, and the air grows suddenly dense—heavy with the taste of iron and mildew. The mouth of the tunnel is sealed by a circular slab etched with spiraling symbols. Some glow faintly when breath fogs the air. Others seem to shift when no one watches.</p>
<p>To open the path forward, grief must be named—or misunderstood pain must be paid.</p>
<h3>Paint the Scene</h3>
<p>Ask the players:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the runes pulses when you get close. What memory flashes behind your eyes?</li>
<li>What smell from your childhood is suddenly, violently present?</li>
<li>What part of your body begins to ache for no clear reason?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Traps / Hazards</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Runes of Confession</strong>:<br>
The seal can only be opened by correctly interpreting the runes—symbols of sorrow, loss, and memory. Attempting to pry or force the seal triggers a <strong>psychic scream</strong>:<br>
<em>Effect</em>: Each party member must pass a <strong>Willpower or Resolve check</strong>, or suffer hallucinations of past failures and gain 1 Ruin or Burden.</li>
<li><strong>The Echo Wall</strong>:<br>
Any word spoken too loudly is repeated back—mockingly—by the stones, but <em>changed slightly</em>, revealing a darker truth.<br>
<em>Effect</em>: Insightful players may use this as a clue, or fall prey to disorientation and delay.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treasures / Secrets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Mourner’s Signet</strong> fits perfectly into a circular recess near the slab. If used, the seal will open without harm—and one of the runes whispers a forgotten truth to the wearer.</li>
<li><strong>Candle of Remorse</strong> (if lit) causes the wall to bleed faint glowing lines that trace a safe path forward—only visible to those who’ve spoken a regret at the well.</li>
<li><strong>Fragment of a Forgotten Psalm</strong> is scrawled faintly in the dust. Reciting it with sincerity may open the seal or draw something <em>else</em> near.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visual &amp; Sensory Cues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mist clings low along the floor, rolling like breath from unseen mouths.</li>
<li>A sound like weeping echoes faintly from deeper within.</li>
<li>Carvings of faceless figures line the sides of the arch, some with hands outstretched as if offering—or warning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transitions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forward</strong>: Into the <strong>Hidden Tunnel</strong>—a narrow, winding descent lined with sorrow-stained stone.</li>
<li><strong>Back</strong>: Return up the <strong>Well Shaft</strong>—though now, the ladder feels longer.</li>
</ul>
