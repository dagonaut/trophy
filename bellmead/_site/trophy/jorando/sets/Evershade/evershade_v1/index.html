<p>The village of <strong>Evershade</strong> once thrived on the shores of the [[Lake of Tears]], sustained by its proximity to the [[Church of the Hollowed Saints]]. The villagers were devoted followers of the church, and many of them worked as caretakers of the holy site, tending to the church’s needs and supporting the pilgrims who came to seek solace in the lake’s sorrowful waters.</p>
<p>As [[The Broken Legion]]'s influence spread, the amount of mourners grew exponentially, but the nature of their sorrow had changed. Turned darker, more violent, seeking vengeance--not peace.</p>
<p>The streets of Evershade are silent and overgrown, with crumbling houses and thick vines blocking out the sun. The air is heavy with the scent of decay, and the echoes of past lives seem to linger in the shadows.</p>

<li>Note Found: <em>“The air grows thick with sorrow, heavier each day. The lake no longer reflects the light; it only swallows it whole. The whispers speak of a reckoning, of shadows creeping from the marshes, of saints no longer hallowed but truly hollow. The tears will drown more than just our hopes. May the gods have mercy on our souls.”</em> -Father Lorian</li>

<h3>The Last Pilgrim</h3>
<p>This is a special encounter</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The Last Pilgrim is a gaunt, enigmatic figure who roams the desolate remnants of Evershade, driven by a singular, unwavering purpose. Clad in tattered, once-ceremonial robes that flutter in the wind, the Pilgrim’s face is obscured by a weathered hood and a metal mask resembling a weeping visage. Their hands are gloved and clutch a staff topped with an intricately carved symbol of a fallen star, a relic of forgotten rituals.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The Last Pilgrim was once a devout guardian of the sacred rites that governed Evershade. When the village fell to ruin and the Shattered Legion’s invasion disrupted their duties, they became a solitary figure, desperately trying to uphold the lost traditions and protect what remains of the village’s sanctity. Now, they wander the ruins, seeking to restore the village’s honor or, failing that, to ensure its secrets remain undisturbed.</p>
<p><strong>Abilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Blessing of the Forgotten:</strong> The Pilgrim channels ancient rites to invoke protective wards that create barriers of spiritual energy, reducing incoming damage by 50% and making it difficult for enemies to approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wail of Desolation:</strong> The Pilgrim emits a mournful wail that echoes through the ruins, causing nearby enemies to suffer a -2 penalty to their attack rolls and forcing them to make a Willpower check or become disoriented for one turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spectral Conjure:</strong> With a sweep of their staff, the Pilgrim summons spectral apparitions that can harass and distract foes. These apparitions deal minor psychic damage and cause confusion, imposing a -1 penalty on rolls related to combat or decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sacred Rebirth:</strong> When reduced to half HP, the Pilgrim can perform a ritual that temporarily shields them from harm, regaining 10% of their total HP and gaining a +1 bonus to their defense rolls for the next turn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Burdened by Duty:</strong> The Pilgrim is driven by their sense of responsibility and can become fixated on protecting certain locations or artifacts, making them less responsive to threats outside their immediate focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emotional Vulnerability:</strong> The Pilgrim’s resolve is tied to the village’s fate, and they are deeply affected by any desecration or disruption of sacred sites. Actions that mock or threaten their mission can cause them to lose focus, imposing a -2 penalty to their abilities for a short period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treasure and Rewards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pilgrim’s Staff:</strong> A magical staff that enhances the wielder's spiritual abilities, granting +2 to rolls related to protective spells and rituals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mask of the Weeping Visage:</strong> A mask that, when worn, provides resistance to fear-based effects and grants the wearer the ability to sense nearby magical disturbances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Last Pilgrim’s Cloak:</strong> A tattered cloak that offers +1 to defense rolls and has a chance to temporarily conceal the wearer in shadows, making them harder to hit in combat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Last Pilgrim: An invasion! Clad in tattered, once-ceremonial robes that flutter in the wind, the Pilgrim’s face is obscured by a weathered hood and a metal mask resembling a weeping visage. Their hands are gloved and clutch a staff topped with an intricately carved symbol of a fallen star, a relic of forgotten rituals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger: Taking anything from his alter at the Forgotten Shrine</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lore:</strong></p>
<p>The Last Pilgrim is a tragic remnant of Evershade’s once-sacred order. Their presence is a poignant reminder of the village’s lost glory and the profound sense of duty that bound its people. As they wander the ruins, their quest remains—to either reclaim their lost heritage or to ensure that the village’s secrets are preserved, even if it means facing those who now intrude upon their sacred ground.</p>
<h3>Boss:</h3>
<p><strong>[[The Stone Sentinel of Evershade]] (Endurance 10)</strong></p>
<p>The Stone Sentinel is a towering golem crafted from the very stones of Evershade, brought to life by ancient magic to protect the village from the despair that has consumed the land. Unlike the cursed and sorrowful spirits that haunt the area, the Stone Sentinel is a being of pure, unwavering resolve, impervious to the emotions that plague the living. Its body is formed from large, jagged stones, bound together by glowing runes that pulse with an inner light. Moss and vines have grown over its surface, giving it a semblance of age and permanence, as if it has stood guard for centuries.</p>
<p>The golem has been chiseled to resemble a knight in armor, though upon closer look, it is a single piece of solid stone. It wields a massive sword in one hand, made of the same stone. The Stone Sentinel patrols the ruins of Evershade, crushing any who dare to disturb the cursed grounds it was created to protect.</p>
<p><strong>Trophy Gold Mechanics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack: Crushing Blow</strong> – The Stone Sentinel brings down its massive hammer with earth-shattering force, dealing devastating damage to a single target. If the target is not able to dodge or deflect the blow, they are knocked prone and stunned.</li>
<li><strong>Special: Unyielding Defense</strong> – The golem raises its stone shield, creating an impenetrable barrier that absorbs all incoming attacks for a short period. During this time, the Stone Sentinel is nearly invulnerable, and players must find a way to outmaneuver or outlast this defense.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Hazard: Tremor</strong> – When the Stone Sentinel moves, it causes the ground to quake, creating tremors that can knock players off their feet or cause parts of the ruins to collapse, creating additional hazards in the battlefield.</li>
<li><strong>Weakness: Cracked Core</strong> – While the Stone Sentinel is impervious to despair, its body has a hidden flaw: a cracked core within its chest. Players must discover this weakness during the fight and target it directly to deal significant damage. Doing so requires precise timing and coordination, as the core is only exposed during certain attack sequences.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Treasures:</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heartstone of the Sentinel</strong> (Amulet) – A small shard of the Stone Sentinel’s core, still faintly glowing with magical energy. When worn, it grants the wearer resistance to physical damage but makes them more vulnerable to magical attacks. The Heartstone also provides the wearer with a temporary shield that can absorb a single powerful blow.</li>
<li><strong>Sword of Evershade</strong> (Weapon) – The Stone Sentinel’s massive stone sword, now imbued with the lingering magic of the golem. While incredibly heavy, it deals massive damage and can cause tremors with each strike. The sword is difficult to wield effectively without great strength.</li>
<li><strong>Sentinel’s Aegis</strong> (Armor) – A piece of the Stone Sentinel’s body, reforged into a durable armor plate. It provides exceptional protection against physical attacks and has the ability to briefly create a magical barrier, reflecting a portion of the damage back to attackers. The armor is heavy and reduces the wearer’s mobility.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My Dearest Liora,</strong></p>

Time has tarnished the silver, but a faint glow emanates from the locket, as if it still holds the warmth of the love that once filled it. Inside, there are two tiny portraits—one of Alaric and the other of Liora—painted with exquisite detail. Beneath the portraits, folded within the locket, is a dried, pressed flower, the same kind that bloomed in Evershade before the village fell into ruin.</p>
<p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whisper of the Past:</strong> When held close, the locket allows the wearer to hear faint echoes of conversations and memories from those who once lived in Evershade. This can be used to uncover hidden secrets or gain insight into the village's past.</li>
<li><strong>Guiding Light:</strong> In times of danger or darkness, the locket emits a soft, guiding light, illuminating the path ahead and helping the wearer navigate treacherous areas.</li>
<li><strong>Bound by Love:</strong> The locket carries a powerful emotional resonance. It grants the wearer resistance to fear-based effects and despair, as it serves as a reminder of love’s enduring strength, even in the face of overwhelming darkness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lore:</strong> The locket was a gift from Alaric to Liora, a symbol of their eternal love and the vows they made to each other. Though they were separated by the tragic events that befell Evershade, the locket remains a testament to their bond, imbued with the lingering essence of their devotion.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> The player can use the Silver Locket of Eternal Vows as a tool for exploration and protection. It may also play a role in unraveling the deeper mysteries of Evershade, as the memories it reveals could provide crucial clues to the village's downfall and the fate of its inhabitants.</p>
