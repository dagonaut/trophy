<p><em>Twisted undead soldier | Challenge Rating: 5-9</em></p>
<p><strong>Appearance:</strong><br>
Clad in splintered armor pitted with rust and age, the Shattered Legion Soldier moves with unnerving precision. Bits of bone show through cracked gauntlets, and their eyeless helms leak a faint blue mist. Their tabards bear the faded symbol of a forgotten empire—now more shroud than banner. They march as if still awaiting orders, blades held in trembling readiness.</p>
<p><strong>Abilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phantom Formation:</strong><br>
Shattered Legion Soldiers fight in eerie coordination. When fighting in pairs, they gain +1 to attack and defense. If one is slain, the survivor goes into a frenzy (+1 to damage but -1 to defense).</li>
<li><strong>Drillmaster’s Echo:</strong><br>
The ghostly voice of their old commander lingers. Once per encounter, they can mimic a tactical shout that forces opponents within earshot to reroll a successful dodge or parry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weakness:</strong><br>
<strong>Broken Memories</strong> — A soldier falters when shown relics of their former life. Wearing the <strong>Phantom Commander's Sigil</strong> or invoking the name of someone from their past causes hesitation or confusion, making them lose their action for a round.</p>
<p><strong>Behavior (d6):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Polishes a rusted blade with mechanical care, unaware of its own decay.</li>
<li>Marches in a looping patrol, footsteps perfectly timed with an unseen rhythm.</li>
<li>Stares at a ruined standard, unmoving, until disturbed.</li>
<li>Reenacts a long-forgotten skirmish with invisible enemies.</li>
<li>Offers a half-salute to anything it perceives as an officer.</li>
<li>Murmurs a dying oath—“Hold the line… for the hollowed…”—before drawing steel.</li>
</ol>
