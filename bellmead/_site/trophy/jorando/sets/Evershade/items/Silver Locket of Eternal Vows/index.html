<h3><strong>Silver Locket of Eternal Vows</strong></h3>
<p><em>A finely wrought silver locket on a delicate chain, tarnished by age yet unbroken. Within, behind a sheet of cracked glass, is a faded portrait of two lovers in a final embrace. The locket hums faintly with warmth when held near the old mural beneath the bell tower.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Love endures—even when it’s not supposed to.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong><br>
When worn near the mural in the bell tower, the locket causes hidden glyphs to reveal themselves—glyphs detailing the Reclamation ritual. It also grants brief resistance to spirit influence while worn.</p>
<p>More note:
The locket is small and intricately crafted, its surface engraved with delicate patterns of entwined vines and flowers. Time has tarnished the silver, but a faint glow emanates from the locket, as if it still holds the warmth of the love that once filled it. Inside, there are two tiny portraits—one of Alaric and the other of Liora—painted with exquisite detail. Beneath the portraits, folded within the locket, is a dried, pressed flower, the same kind that bloomed in Evershade before the village fell into ruin.</p>
