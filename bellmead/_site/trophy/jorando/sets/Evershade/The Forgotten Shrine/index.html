<em>Hidden near the village’s outer edge—where stone gives way to mud and ivy—the Forgotten Shrine slouches beneath a collapsed tree. Time has nearly buried it. A single standing column remains, etched with a deity’s sigil worn smooth by centuries of rain and grief. Offerings, long decayed, still cling to the altar: wilted flowers, broken lockets, and bits of cloth once soaked in tears. Despite the ruin, something sacred lingers here… and something watching.</em></p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">What has been offered on the alter?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trap / Hazard / Encounter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desecration Trigger</strong>: Removing any item from the altar immediately summons <strong>The Last Pilgrim</strong>. They appear behind the shrine with silent fury, attacking without hesitation. If players replace the offering afterward, the Pilgrim’s rage subsides—but only briefly.</li>
<li><strong>Lingering Divinity</strong>: If one attempts a ritual here without proper reverence, the shrine <strong>curses</strong> them. For one scene, their weapons are considered &quot;hollow,&quot; unable to affect spirits or guardians. Only performing a <strong>restorative act of faith or mourning</strong> will lift the curse.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proper Offering</strong>: Placing a meaningful token of grief (like the <em>Silver Locket</em>, <em>Faded Love Letter</em>, or a personal item tied to backstory) on the altar may do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Reveal a <strong>moment of memory</strong>: a vision of the village before it fell, showing the hidden path to the Weeping Well.</li>
<li>Temporarily <strong>calm all spirits</strong> in the area for one scene.</li>
<li>Call forth the Last Pilgrim in a <strong>non-hostile form</strong>, willing to answer one question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Writ of Forgotten Rites</strong>: Hidden beneath a cracked stone tile at the shrine’s base is a weathered scroll describing <strong>how to sanctify cursed ground</strong>. Useful for subverting the Lake or pacifying the Hollowed Spirits in the Tavern.</li>
<li><strong>Cracked Idol</strong>: A small stone figure buried in the mud behind the shrine. When held during sleep, it causes sorrowful dreams—but grants the user a vision of someone they lost or failed. (Next morning, they may remove 1 Ruin, but lose 1 Resolve.)</li>
</ul>
