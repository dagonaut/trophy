<p><em>Once a symbol of hope, now stands crumbling and silent. Its bell, tarnished and cracked, no longer rings. Ivy and decay have overtaken the stone, hiding the secrets of forgotten vows. Beneath its shadow, echoes of the village's tragic past linger, waiting to be uncovered.</em></p>
<p>The crumbling stone bell tower looms above the village like a mournful sentinel, its crooked spire rising through the mist. Ivy coils tightly around its frame, as if trying to hold the structure together. The bell itself, cracked and silent, hangs askew from a frayed rope that sways in windless air. Below, the steps leading up are slick with moss and water, and the ground is strewn with rotting prayer ribbons and faded etchings of names long forgotten. This was once the place where vows were spoken—and broken.</p>
<p><strong>Trap / Hazard / Encounter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Tolling Memory</strong>: Ringing the bell (accidentally or purposefully) causes a powerful echo to roll across the village. All within earshot must pass a <strong>Willpower check</strong> or become overwhelmed with a memory that isn’t theirs—suffering disorientation, despair, or momentary paralysis as they relive a tragic vow unkept. (Gain 1 Ruin on failure.)</li>
<li><strong>Collapsed Spiral</strong>: The wooden stairs inside the tower are fragile. Any quick movement or combat here risks triggering a <strong>collapse</strong>, sending intruders tumbling into the rubble below. Characters must roll to maintain balance or risk falling and becoming trapped or injured.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hidden Chamber Beneath the Tower</strong>: As hinted in the <strong>Faded Love Letter</strong>, a narrow passage concealed under loose stones leads to a secret compartment. Inside is a dried flower and a small <strong>Reliquary of Alaric and Liora</strong>—containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Lock of Liora’s Hair</strong> (used in rituals of memory or scrying)</li>
<li>A <strong>Bone Ring</strong> etched with a half-faded vow (“...until the lake forgets our names”)</li>
<li>A <strong>Silver Key</strong> that opens a hidden drawer in the Weeping Well crypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Echoing Bell (Usable Item)</strong>: If repaired and rung with proper intent, the bell can <strong>repel hostile spirits</strong> for one scene—its sound acting like a ward. But it also calls <em>something else</em> from across the lake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inscription of Names</strong>: Etched into the stone behind the bell is a list of names—many of them matching tombstones or spectral figures seen throughout Evershade. Scratching your name here either protects you from the spirits… or binds you to them. Your choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
