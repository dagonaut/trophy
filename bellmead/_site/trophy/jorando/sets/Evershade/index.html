<p>The village of <strong>Evershade</strong> once thrived on the shores of the [[Lake of Tears]], sustained by its proximity to the [[Church of the Hollowed Saints]]. The villagers were devoted followers of the church, and many of them worked as caretakers of the holy site, tending to the church’s needs and supporting the pilgrims who came to seek solace in the lake’s sorrowful waters.</p>
<p>As [[The Broken Legion]]'s influence spread, the amount of mourners grew exponentially, but the nature of their sorrow had changed. Turned darker, more violent, seeking vengeance--not peace.</p>
<p>The streets of Evershade are silent and overgrown, with crumbling houses and thick vines blocking out the sun. The air is heavy with the scent of decay, and the echoes of past lives seem to linger in the shadows.</p>

<li>Note Found: <em>“The air grows thick with sorrow, heavier each day. The lake no longer reflects the light; it only swallows it whole. The whispers speak of a reckoning, of shadows creeping from the marshes, of saints no longer hallowed but truly hollow. The tears will drown more than just our hopes. May the gods have mercy on our souls.”</em> -Father Lorian</li>
</ul>
<h3>Locations / Traps / Opportunities:</h3>
<h5>[[The Hollowed Tavern]]</h5>
<p>Once a lively gathering place, the tavern is now a hollow shell, filled with broken furniture and the faintest echoes of laughter. Spirits of the villagers sometimes manifest here, replaying their final moments.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">What are the spirirts/shades doing?</span></li>
</ul>
<h5>[[The Silent Graveyard]]</h5>
<p>A small, overgrown graveyard behind the village. The graves are marked with simple stones, and the air is thick with the presence of restless spirits.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a shimmering red sign on a gravestone. You can touch this to summon the Pilgrim (this is a different interaction than if you stole something)</li>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Describe a gravestone... how does it relate to <em>your</em> story?</span></li>
</ul>
<h5>[[The Forgotten Shrine]]</h5>
<p>Near the edge of the village lies a small, forgotten shrine dedicated to an unnamed deity. The shrine is covered in moss and ivy, with offerings left by the villagers before they abandoned the place. Some believe that this deity still watches over the village, its power diminished but not entirely gone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trap: Taking something from the alter summons [[The Last Pilgrim]]</li>

<h3>Moments of Light:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Petals in the Rain</strong>: As mist falls in a steady, gentle drizzle, a gust of wind scatters a cascade of bright golden petals down the narrow village lane. They drift past your feet, untouched by rot, before vanishing beneath the stone where the sun once kissed the earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Child’s Laughter (Echo)</strong>: From the silent tavern’s broken doorway, you hear a burst of laughter—light and innocent. A small wooden toy rolls gently across the floor. When you pick it up, it’s warm to the touch, as though recently held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lantern Still Burning</strong> In the shadow of the bell tower, nestled in ivy, a small pilgrim’s lantern flickers with silver-blue flame. It emits no heat, but it holds back the darkness with steady grace. It cannot be extinguished by any mundane means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Whispered Vow</strong>: Near the Forgotten Shrine, two voices overlap faintly: one male, one female. You can’t quite make out their words, but they repeat in unison, over and over—until you recognize them as vows. If you hold your breath, you might hear your own name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Kindness of the Dead</strong>: A spirit appears before you, not in anger but in grief. It places a small charm into your palm—an offering. Then it slowly dissolves into mist, the burden of memory lightened, if only for a moment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
