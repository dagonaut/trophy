<p>The Stone Sentinel is a towering golem crafted from the very stones of Evershade, brought to life by ancient magic to protect the village from the despair that has consumed the land. Unlike the cursed and sorrowful spirits that haunt the area, the Stone Sentinel is a being of pure, unwavering resolve, impervious to the emotions that plague the living. Its body is formed from large, jagged stones, bound together by glowing runes that pulse with an inner light. Moss and vines have grown over its surface, giving it a semblance of age and permanence, as if it has stood guard for centuries.</p>
<p>The golem has been chiseled to resemble a knight in armor, though upon closer look, it is a single piece of solid stone. It wields a massive sword in one hand, made of the same stone. The Stone Sentinel patrols the ruins of Evershade, crushing any who dare to disturb the cursed grounds it was created to protect.</p>
<p><strong>Trophy Gold Mechanics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack: Crushing Blow</strong> – The Stone Sentinel brings down its massive hammer with earth-shattering force, dealing devastating damage to a single target. If the target is not able to dodge or deflect the blow, they are knocked prone and stunned.</li>
<li><strong>Special: Unyielding Defense</strong> – The golem raises its stone shield, creating an impenetrable barrier that absorbs all incoming attacks for a short period. During this time, the Stone Sentinel is nearly invulnerable, and players must find a way to outmaneuver or outlast this defense.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Hazard: Tremor</strong> – When the Stone Sentinel moves, it causes the ground to quake, creating tremors that can knock players off their feet or cause parts of the ruins to collapse, creating additional hazards in the battlefield.</li>
<li><strong>Weakness: Cracked Core</strong> – While the Stone Sentinel is impervious to despair, its body has a hidden flaw: a cracked core within its chest. Players must discover this weakness during the fight and target it directly to deal significant damage. Doing so requires precise timing and coordination, as the core is only exposed during certain attack sequences.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treasures:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heartstone of the Sentinel</strong> (Amulet) – A small shard of the Stone Sentinel’s core, still faintly glowing with magical energy. When worn, it grants the wearer resistance to physical damage but makes them more vulnerable to magical attacks. The Heartstone also provides the wearer with a temporary shield that can absorb a single powerful blow.</li>
<li><strong>Sword of Evershade</strong> (Weapon) – The Stone Sentinel’s massive stone sword, now imbued with the lingering magic of the golem. While incredibly heavy, it deals massive damage and can cause tremors with each strike. The sword is difficult to wield effectively without great strength.</li>
<li><strong>Sentinel’s Aegis</strong> (Armor) – A piece of the Stone Sentinel’s body, reforged into a durable armor plate. It provides exceptional protection against physical attacks and has the ability to briefly create a magical barrier, reflecting a portion of the damage back to attackers. The armor is heavy and reduces the wearer’s mobility.</li>
</ul>
