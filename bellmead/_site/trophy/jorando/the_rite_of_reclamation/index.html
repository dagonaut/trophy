<p><strong>THE RITE OF RECLAMATION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;To unmake what sorrow hath made, one must mourn in reverseâ€”remembering joy, restoring names, reassembling what was hollowed.&quot;</em>
â€”Inscription found on the <em>Fragment of the First Tear</em></p>

<h2>ðŸŒ¿ Three Pillars of Reclamation</h2>
<p>A multi-set restoration mechanic intended to reverse the corruption of Jorando and return it to a place where sorrow can be relieved, not compounded. Completing all three pillars is required to unlock the final Rite at the Fountain and the Mirror.</p>
<hr>
<h3>1. <strong>The Recollection of True Names</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;When the lake forgot the names of those who wept into it, the sorrow had no anchorâ€”and so it grew monstrous.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recover and restore the <strong>True Names</strong> of those lost to the lake and time.</li>
<li>Names are found in fragments, relics, whispered through spirits, or recorded in fading texts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scroll of Forgotten Kin</strong> (Evershade): Use at shrines to recover names and illuminate memories.</li>
<li><strong>Saintâ€™s Ledger</strong> (Ruined Church): Encoded entries reveal names, unlocking localized healing.</li>
<li><strong>Name of the Lost</strong> (Weeping Well): Speak a name aloud to calm the waters for a time.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>2. <strong>The Cleansing of Waters</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The lake was pure onceâ€”fed not by tears of despair, but by those willingly given, as part of a rite to heal.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cleanse corrupted water sources using relics, prayers, or rites.</li>
<li>Purification brings clarity and unlocks emotional and physical access to sealed areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vial of Blessed Silt</strong> (Cistern): Sprinkle into corrupted pools to suppress sorrowful effects.</li>
<li><strong>Drowned Roots</strong> (Whispering Marshes): Burn while reciting a chant from <em>The Axe</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Hymnal of the Brimming Veil</strong> (Ruined Church): Must be sung by moonlight to cleanse lakewater.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>3. <strong>The Realignment of Time</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;It is not the sorrow that warps Jorando, but its echoâ€”looped through time, unhealed. The rite demands a witness from each era.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reclaim emotional echoes from each era and deliver them to the final location: <em>The Fountain and the Mirror</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mirror of Before</strong> (crafted from Hidden Tunnel + Axe relics): See a place's past.</li>
<li><strong>The Witness of Tears</strong> (NPC): Lead them to sacred spots to record echoes.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Ley Stelae</strong> (beneath Lake of Tears): Reactivated to sing the counter-dirge.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>ðŸ•¯ Final Rite: The Fountain and the Mirror</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Only by naming, cleansing, and remembering can sorrow release its grip. Only then will the fountain run sweet again, and the mirror reflect joy.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Once all three pillars are fulfilled:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Journey to the metaphysical <strong>Fountain and the Mirror</strong>, beneath the lake.</li>
<li>Options:
<ul>
<li><strong>Undo the corruption</strong>: One party member must remain.</li>
<li><strong>Seal the sorrow</strong>: Cuts off miracle access permanently.</li>
<li><strong>Rewrite history</strong>: Risks greater or stranger outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>ðŸŒ™ Optional Mechanics</h2>
<h3><strong>Despair / Hope Tokens</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Track the groupâ€™s descent or ascent.</li>
<li>Hope tokens may be spent for rerolls or ritual invocations.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Chronicle of Healing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Player log of names, locations, and echoes restored.</li>
<li>Used to reference progress and narratively reshape Jorando.</li>
</ul>
