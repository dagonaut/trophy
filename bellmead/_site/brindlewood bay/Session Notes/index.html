Hazel McGuyver's her way into the bedroom (flamingo, rake, garden hose)
Finds that they have a kinky sexual situation
Meddles and finds a duplicate costume, hastily discarded, when finding it, it gets pulled out so the clue will be seen if someone comes in.</p>
<p>Fridge. Ernie leads the party and the passage leads to the private screening room behind the screen (theory is he used that so he could watch audiences). There's an old director's chair behind the screen from a director that he hates &quot;Scorsese&quot;.</p>
<p>Ernie uses her composure to observe. Nelly sits on the chair and breaks it, knocks Tilly over and she falls through the screen tearing it. Markus is aware of us. Puts something in his briefcase, locks it, and bolts (Allegedly crying while smoking weed).</p>
<p>Ernie chasing Markus. Nellie follows.</p>
<p>Tilly and Hy go back through the fridge--investigate for an alternative passage--no dice.</p>
<p>Hy goes hard and she's a professional archivist of the performance of death and that gives her license to check the body (Remington Steele). She uses this to meddle. She finds some tampered with Candy.</p>
<p>We confront Coco... correctly.</p>
<p>Frankenstein is a Dark Void Agent... but not really.</p>
<p>Hooded figures on the beach around a pillar with a mirror on top. Smooth white masks under hoods. The central figure pulls his mask down and pulls out a curved dagger and carves out his eye. Hold the eye to the mirror, in the reflection the eye comes to life.</p>

<p>African Amarula Pie
Bobotie - meat pie</p>
<p>Gave Nellie a hug (like a handshake)</p>
<p>Hy pulls out her NYPD windbreaker to make her way into dead bodies' trailer.
Riviera is tied up.
Nellie meddles looking into the batter; tastes like a good vanilla sponge.
Hazel inadvertently rolls over Riviera and that alerts everyone up to what we're doing.
Ernie confronts Scott, he throws his pie at her. He has beef with Riviera.</p>
<p>Hazel has gotten in with Tim Boosh.</p>
<p>A storm's a brewin'.
Diamond encrusted bread loaf earrings.</p>
<hr>
<p>2025-04-08</p>
<p>There is a special bread recipe in the book that was actually written by his wife and the earrings were a thank you from Paul to Donna. The earrings are actually in Paul's trailer.</p>
<p>Tilly is over near her ride (Macaroni) and she thinks she sees someone sneaking into the house. She gonna peep up on them using Macaroni to get closer. (S!). She sees Sue Melon sneak inside, looking sketchy. She lays on the horn to try to scare her so she reveals something. She put some papers in the desk and Tilly gets them (CLUE - plea for financial help). Tilly is in a nice study. There is a painting with a brass plaque that says &quot;Founders of Brindlewood Bay&quot; with a book with a glass dome over it. Tilly learns something</p>
<p>There are some descendants of the town founders, they came from the Deep Reaver. They sailed here and most of the crew/passengers were killed during the battle of the whale. The survivors landed on the shores of BwBay and they carved up the Whale and sold it off to people all over the world. That's the nest egg that created the town. All of them only were able to survive because they made a pact with something deeper and darker than the whale.</p>
<p>Hazel chops it up with Tim and being outsiders, comedic relief. No one takes him seriously. They don't appreciate what they have. They're Divas. Paul and Jane got into a huge argument about politics and couldn't put on their professional face, so they cancelled the rest of the day.  Hazel also shares how to get stains out of the chairs.</p>
<p>Sheriff &amp; Deputy arrive. Ernie rolls up on them and tries to distract them. She tries to put meringue in the deputy's mouth. She gets put in the squad car.</p>
<p>Hy is heading to Jane's trailer. The Sheriff tries to stop her and Hy says she needs to discuss lady things (12!). Sheriff's face turns beet red and walks the opposite direction, no questions asked. Jane's room is very British. Hy brings up the book/recipe, she is insulted, gets up and storms out, leaving Hy there where she finds clues.</p>
<p>Nellie get's buck to get him some whoopie pies and he has done run off with some pain killers. Climbs a tree to get into a second story window. There are a ton of love letters all signed by the prime minister. Nellie leaves and runs into Eudora (Dorie) Coffin. The chair of the BB lunch club. She's a lady about town, well connected.</p>
<p>They call everyone back for the show stopper.</p>
<p>Hazel talks about her spruce goose. Ernie does some meddling and finds that the powder was rat poison (CLUE).</p>
<p>Ernie's cake is about pie.
Hy's is about birds.
Scott's show stopper looks like a dick. Jane doesn't get it.</p>
<p>Hazel shoots her plane across the tent (VOID/CLUE)</p>
<p>Tilly's bull/cow cake</p>
<p>As Hy wins the show, she lays out the solution.</p>
<p>We head inside to the basement and meet Dorie Coffin. She offers us tea. She introduces herself. She's a direct descendant of Darius Coffin from the Deep Reaver. The Founders came in and all descendants stayed and run things and have position. She tells us a story:</p>
<p>In the summer of 1893: Hail Willoby. A survivor of the ship. A horrible event happened. 13 women and children butchered in a schoolhouse. We found Hale covered in blood. He was doing what was &quot;promised to them below&quot;. Despite all the evidence he was found innocent. Stockton farms shack is where he lived out his days. Spooky shit out there. Tilly coyly asks if they serve... &quot;whale&quot;?</p>
<p>She wants to know if we're good candidates for lunch club.</p>
<p>During the credits...</p>
<p>NOTE: in level 2 of VOID mystery.</p>

<p>Hyacinth has known George Pollard since he was running the dry cleaners way back when. Whales were always his real passion.</p>
<p>There are few windows to avoid damaging the artifacts inside.</p>
<p>Macaroni has a nautical theme.</p>
<p>Audrey is crying and she has found Edgar dead in the scrimshaw exhibit, he has been stabbed by a harpoon. Sam Cooper, off duty detective, walks in.</p>
<p>Hazel takes Audrey aside to the bathroom (where she once got busy) and comforts her. Just in time, and George and Prof. were getting into it.</p>
<p>Tilly is going to Columbo. She's going to bust out some Whale facts, mostly wrong and about whale genitals. I'm looking for his whale bone. 12! Tilly stumbles into a display case. George is pissed, however, you guys notice that the case is empty (and it weren't supposed to be).</p>
<p>Hyacinth meddles talking to George. He's in a bad mood and she's going to irritate him. Hyacinth marks a condition (George is pissed at her).</p>
<p>Nellie wanders into the Scrimshaw room with a fish stick and saunters up to see what Cooper is up to. Cooper's like why are you here? We're good at this kind of thing. How can I help? Cooper is kind of mad that she's off duty, so she shows Nellie. Nellie notices some black scrimshaw in the display case (but not on display). It is covered in esoteric/alien markings. Nellie has lost her taste for Fish Sticks.</p>
<p>Ernie talks to Krish about the boyfriend angle. Ernie gets a little close and physical with Krish (she also now has internal monologue). She pulls his wallet and purposefully drops his wallet so she can pick it up and get a gander before handing it back. --notes: should've been a day move following the 7-9 on the meddle move-- Krish runs. Ernie shouts, Berko runs out and spears Krish.</p>
<p>NOTE:
--we haven't been doing Day move correctly; ask what you're afraid will happen; 7-9 is bad vulnerable, choose whether or not to do it--</p>
<p>Hyacinth starts interrogating Cornelius, who's not bothered because he's drinking from a flask that he shares with Hyacinth. He's being quite jovial and pulls out some financial reports that he shares with her. She is also drunk.</p>
<p>Hazel sits in the theater to relax. The lights go down, the screen comes to life, and film begins. It's Dorie Coffin. Hazel, I'm not pleased with what's going on. She's basically on a teams call. She's warning us to keep our noses out of where it doesn't belong. She represents The Midwives of the Fragrant Void. Finds a pocket knife clue.</p>
<p>Tilly is gathering trash from the lobby using her harpoon. She is concerned a shadowy figure is going to get her. She turns and sees a silhouette of herself holding a harpoon. They run immediately, dropping their harpoon. VOID Harpoon.</p>
<p>Ernie talks to Prof. Schwartz. Her angle is genealogy and seduction. Prof. is digging through their shit and is up to no good. Ernie seduces him and gets him on her side. He reveals a clue. Prof is angling to get George removed and take this over. He won't open it, but encourages him to.</p>
<p>Nellie will talk to Dr. Berko. A whale killed Nellie's father... through distraction. Berko hates this place. She's conversing with Berko about Edgar. She tells her about the thesis. She is then removed and the door locked behind her.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hy, Tilly, &amp; Ernie go to speak with Prof. about the whaling history specifically related to spooky shit. We talk about Hale Willoby. Prof tells us more. In the spring of 1942 on the beach some townsfolk found the wreckage of a Nazi U-boat that had been torn to pieces. There were strange occult symbols found. There was 1 reported survivor. He died by repeatedly slamming his own head in the wall after he was sent to the asylum. He was talking gibberish. Prof has a piece of the boat at the college.</p>
