<p>Game Overview</p>
<p>&quot;ONE UGLY MOTHERFUCKER&quot; is a competitive story game for 3+ players where one player is the mysterious Hunter, an alien creature that kills humans for sport, and the others are the Prey, a group of heavily armed soldiers. 1As Prey are killed, their players become an aspect of the Hunter, complicating things immensely. 2The game uses d6s, where a +/- bonus allows adjustment of the dice result up or down. 3</p>
<p>Game Phases</p>

<p><strong>Key Mechanics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Loud and Quiet Actions:</strong> All mechanical aspects are divided into two categories: Loud (violence, action, gunfire and explosions) and Quiet (stealth, sneaking, improvisation and fieldcraft). 8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stats:</strong> Prey characters assign a number between 1 and 6 to act as their mechanical core, called their Stat. 9999A low number means the character is more Quiet, while a high number means a character is more Loud. 10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dice Rolls:</strong> When rolling, success depends on the scene's Tone (set by the Hunter) and the Prey's Stat. 1111</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prey Character Setup</strong> 12</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Name/Nickname &amp; Role</strong> 13</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stat (1-6)</strong>: A low number (1-3) means the character is more Quiet, while a high number (4-6) means a character is more Loud. 14</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Three Equipment/Traits</strong>: List three pieces of equipment, personal traits, or specialized equipment which express your Stat. 15</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Setup - Hunter's Role</strong> 16</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting</strong>: The Hunter introduces an isolated setting (e.g., deep in the jungle, on a derelict ship, in the middle of a desert, in an abandoned building, or war zones). 17</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cover Story/Mission</strong>: The Hunter comes up with a cover story, mission, or goal that gives the Prey a reason to be there. 18</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>4 Goals</strong>: Set 2 &quot;Quiet&quot; goals (e.g., disabling mines, stealing documents, interrogating a prisoner) and 2 &quot;Loud&quot; goals (e.g., destroying a base, ambushing rebels, blowing up an arms cache). 19</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>https://www.google.com/search?q=Escape Pool</strong>: Place a number of tokens on the table equal to the number of Prey players; this is the https://www.google.com/search?q=Escape Pool. 20</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Hunt - Turn Sequence</strong> 21</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hunter Sets Tone</strong>: At the start of each Turn, the Hunter sets the Tone of the scene (Quiet or Loud). 22On a Quiet turn, the Hunter is silently stalking the Prey, and on a Loud turn, it is openly attacking them. 23</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prey Roll 1d6</strong>: All Prey roll 1d6. 24On a Loud turn, they are successful if they roll equal to or lower than their Stat, and on a Quiet Turn, they are Successful if they roll equal to or higher. 25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scene Control</strong>: The player who rolled lowest on a Quiet turn or highest on a Loud turn takes control of the scene; responsibility is shared if two people roll equally. 26</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: If either all or just one Prey player fails their roll, the Prey who Failed are now Vulnerable. 27If more than one, but not all the Prey failed, or if all the Prey succeeded, they are still safe. 28</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Narrate Scene</strong>: The Prey in charge of the Scene narrates what is happening, partially determined by their roll. 29Check your roll against the following chart to determine what you are able to do. 30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hunter Strike</strong>: At any point during a Turn where somebody is Vulnerable, the Hunter can strike. 31They can interrupt the Scene Controllers to take a single action, instantly killing one of the Vulnerable Prey. 32The Hunter narrates their death, but the slain Prey is allowed to leave one hint about what is stalking them. 33The Hunter player should collect 1 Token for their kill. 34The Hunter can choose not to strike, in which case the Hunter gains 3 Tokens. 35</p>

<p>When a Prey character is eliminated, their Player becomes an aspect of the Hunter. 43</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From that point onward, at the start of each Turn, each Hunter player should collect 1 token. 44</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a bid for control of the Hunter among all Hunter players, where they wager tokens on the premise of a plan to kill the Prey. 45</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hunter players reveal their bids simultaneously via a closed fist auction after no longer than two minutes. 46</p>
</li>
