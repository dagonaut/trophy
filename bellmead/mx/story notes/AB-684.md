https://mxtoolbox.atlassian.net/browse/AB-684

Relevant test:
https://mxtoolbox.com/Admin/SB/ServiceBox/Reporting/abtestdetail.aspx?testid=502

Goal: 
We need to understand the numbers for Internal Upgrade Values and add a cancellation value so we have up-to-date (daily) stats for cancellations as related to them being in an AB Test.

Workflow:
Get a list of MxAbTest rows from dynamo for the given AB-test

`SELECT * FROM mx_yaml_prod_mx_ab_test WHERE AbTestName = 'ab-123'

Extract a list of Alertgroup Ids from the MxAbTest query
Query the Alertgroup Table to get the associated ServiceContractIds
Query the ServiceContract table and select the ID, Status, and CancelledOnDate
Associate the ServiceContract subset with the MxAbTest in a Dictionary.

You end up with List(of DC2ABTestItem)
	.AbTest as MxAbTest
	.ServiceContract as item with {.ID, .Status, .CancelledOnDate}

The ServiceContracts are gathered from active AlertGroups so Discontinued Contracts with NewContractIds (upgrades) should be handled properly
