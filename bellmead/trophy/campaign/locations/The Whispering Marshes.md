*The Whispering Marshes sprawl with unnatural stillness, where the air is thick with fog and sorrow. Once a fertile expanse, the land now chokes on brackish water and creeping vines. The fog whispers secrets—some true, some unkind—feeding on the grief of any who linger. It is a place of transition, between the realms of the living and the dead, between memory and forgetting.*

*Travelers avoid the marshes, claiming that those who enter often forget why they came—or who they are. Strange flowers bloom in silence, and the mud seems to suck at boots with a mind of its own. This is a place where sorrows echo. It is said the dead rise here not out of vengeance, but confusion, trying to finish lives long faded.*

*This is the road to the village [[Evershade]], if you can find it.*

Hidden among the reeds and fog there is an ancient ritual site. The site is marked by mourning stones with faded glyphs, weathered altars, and scattered relics of a bygone era. Strange symbols are etched into the ground and the air feels charged with residual magic. 

**The Mausoleum:**
