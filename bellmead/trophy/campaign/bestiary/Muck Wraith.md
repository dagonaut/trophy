_Amphibious Predator_ {% if h != "hide" %} 10 {% endif %} 

**Appearance:**  
A sinewy, amphibious beast rising from the lake. Its body is slick with algae and muck, glowing eyes like twin lanterns in the mist. Its claws are long, spindly, and too many.

{% if h != "hide" %}
**Abilities/Defenses:**  
- **Tendril Snare:** On a hit, pull a character or their gear into the water. They must Risk Roll to avoid being submerged.      

**Weakness:**  
Bound to the water — grows sluggish if forced onto dry land.

**Behavior (d6):**  
1. Circles just beneath the surface, waiting.      
2. Mimics a drowning cry to lure rescuers.      
3. Snaps at lantern light, trying to extinguish it.      
4. Leaves behind slick trails of algae.      
5. Retreats if struck with iron or salt.      
6. Gurgles in a voice not its own — an echo of past victims.
