**Grotesque Marsh Insect**

**Physical Description:**
A bloated, carapaced insect the size of a hound, its back split open into a nest of writhing feelers and twitching legs. Milky, lidless eyes scan ceaselessly, and its mandibles drip with reeking bile. Its belly is translucent, revealing smaller larvae pulsing within.

- **Piercing Mandibles:** Injects numbing venom; untreated wounds may hatch larvae.
