**Bog Menace**  {% if h != "hide" %} CR 6/7/8/9 (depending on load out) {% endif %}

**Physical Description:**
Waterlogged corpses cloaked in tattered remnants of clothing and lakeweed, their skin bloated and split. Eyes glow faint green from within, and their limbs move with eerie, boneless fluidity. Their mouths constantly leak black water.

**Lore**: 
The remains of those who perished in the marsh long ago. Dank are condemned and drowned in the river like mines.  They try to pull people into the murk alongside them.

{% if h != "hide" %}
**Drops**:
These come in many varieties and drop a broken, rusty version of their weapon if it still exists.
{% endif %}

**Weakness:**
Speaking a prayer aloud and with conviction or a strong holy symbol will cause them to recoil and disperse temporarily.

{% if h != "hide" %}
**Attacks:**
- **Dragging Grasp** – Grabs at a target’s legs with bloated, unyielding hands. If successful, the victim is pulled into the water and must pass a Strength or Reflex check to escape drowning.
- **Waterlogged Wail** – Emits a choking cry of sorrow that floods the ears and mind. All who hear it must test to resist despair or suffer a penalty to Willpower-based actions for the scene.

| 1   | Lurking just beneath the surface of a blackwater pool, eyes just visible.                          |
| 2   | Marching slowly through the fog in a tattered funeral procession, as if reliving their last rites. |
| 3   | Clutching a broken lantern, as though trying to return home.                                       |
| 4   | Circling the base of a Mourning Stone, murmuring inaudibly.                                        |
| 5   | One drags a half-sunken body, as if trying to save it—or drown it.                                 |
| 6   | Floating lifelessly, until disturbed by sound or light, then attacking in frenzy.                  |
