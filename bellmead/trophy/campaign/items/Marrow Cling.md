Additional:
It's a small, parasitic organism that resembles a cluster of twisted, dark gray growths clinging to rocks, trees, and other surfaces in the marsh. Unlike barnacles, which are stationary, Marrow Clings have a faint pulsating motion, as if they are slowly contracting and expanding. Their surface is rough and leathery, covered in tiny, hair-like tendrils that grasp onto anything they touch. 

**If attached, you become lethargic and more susceptible to enemies... specifically [[Lantern Maw]]**

**Behavior**: Latch onto living beings and drain vitality over time.

**Harvesting**: The tendrils of a Marrow Cling can be used in alchemy to create vitality potions, but extracting them is dangerous.

*"Its vitality is yours, but it hungers for more."  

**Effect:** Used in crafting.

There are recipes in the Waterlogged Journal.
This is often collected as "treasure"
To craft with it requires a dark die. It can't give you Ruin, but it can give a condition.

Crafting this, you can apply it to your weapon or armor. Makes armor last twice. Makes weapons +1 to a die roll, but only applies once.
