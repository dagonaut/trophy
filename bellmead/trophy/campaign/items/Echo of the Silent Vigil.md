Liorna tied it in her hair the day Alaric left, a token to match his own. As she stood vigil each night she grew frail until she was little more than a shadow. In death the ribbon fell from her hair and floated on the wind searching for its twin.<br><br>_"I lit the lamp each night, though no footsteps came to the door. Still, I waited"_ |
