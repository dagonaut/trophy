Notes: The Priests were the vessels to take your grief so you donâ€™t need to hold it. They allowed you memory without the burden. However, the priests and the lake itself started to forget. So they had all this sorrow, but didnâ€™t know why and what their purpose was. So it all got whack.

3 things:
Water: Cistern / Lake
Saints/Church: Church
Weeping Well?
Lake?

Create stories that weâ€™re tracking down from the past and they preset Tears/Echos/Memories that are later consumed for the ritual:
 * [[Alaric and Liorna]]
 * The Last Pilgrim
 * The Seer
 * Whomever was last in the [[The Murmuring Cell]] (Reps the Cistern, discovering the secret passage will allow for the finding of his Echo)
 * Someone in the Church - Father Lorain (he was a link between the Church and Evershade). His echo could be found as early as WM
 * Lake? Not necessaryâ€¦ 

Each area needs a story like this that can be used. They all have a puzzle/gimmick to put them to rest and get the echo.

Cleanse The Water - 
Bring the Echos - Collect Echoes
Restore the Choir - Use the Reliquary

You gotta choose between the Reliquary going to the people that hire you or the Reclamation.

## Three Pillars of Reclamation

A multi-set restoration mechanic intended to reverse the corruption of Jorando and return it to a place where sorrow can be relieved, not compounded. Completing all three pillars is required to unlock the final Rite at the Fountain and the Mirror.

---

### 1. **The Recollection of True Names**

> _"When the lake forgot the names of those who wept into it, the sorrow had no anchorâ€”and so it grew monstrous."_

**Mechanics:**
- Recover and restore the **True Names** of those lost to the lake and time.
- Names are found in fragments, relics, whispered through spirits, or recorded in fading texts.

**Examples:**
- **Scroll of Forgotten Kin** (Evershade): Use at shrines to recover names and illuminate memories.
- **Saintâ€™s Ledger** (Ruined Church): Encoded entries reveal names, unlocking localized healing.
- **Name of the Lost** (Weeping Well): Speak a name aloud to calm the waters for a time.

---

### 2. **The Cleansing of Waters**

> _"The lake was pure onceâ€”fed not by tears of despair, but by those willingly given, as part of a rite to heal."_

**Mechanics:**
- Cleanse corrupted water sources using relics, prayers, or rites.
- Purification brings clarity and unlocks emotional and physical access to sealed areas.

**Examples:**
- **Vial of Blessed Silt** (Cistern): Sprinkle into corrupted pools to suppress sorrowful effects.
- **Drowned Roots** (Whispering Marshes): Burn while reciting a chant from *The Axe*.
- **Hymnal of the Brimming Veil** (Ruined Church): Must be sung by moonlight to cleanse lakewater.

---

### 3. **The Realignment of Time**

> _"It is not the sorrow that warps Jorando, but its echoâ€”looped through time, unhealed. The rite demands a witness from each era."_

**Mechanics:**
- Reclaim emotional echoes from each era and deliver them to the final location: *The Fountain*.

**Echo Sources:**
 * Alaric and Liorna -EV
 * The Last Pilgrim -EV
 * The Seer -WW
 * Whomever was last in the [[The Murmuring Cell]] -WW
 * Someone in the Church
 * The Priestâ€™s Jaw or something in the Silt Circle or Mourning Stones -WM

**Examples:**
- **Mirror of Before** (crafted from Hidden Tunnel + Axe relics): See a place's past.
- **The Witness of Tears** (NPC): Lead them to sacred spots to record echoes.
- **Temporal Ley Stelae** (beneath Lake of Tears): Reactivated to sing the counter-dirge.

---

##  Final Rite: The Fountain and the Mirror

> _"Only by naming, cleansing, and remembering can sorrow release its grip. Only then will the fountain run sweet again, and the mirror reflect joy."_

**Once all three pillars are fulfilled:**
- Journey to the metaphysical **Fountain and the Mirror**, beneath the lake.
- Options:
  - **Undo the corruption**: One party member must remain.
  - **Seal the sorrow**: Cuts off miracle access permanently.
  - **Rewrite history**: Risks greater or stranger outcomes.

---

##  Optional Mechanics

### **Despair / Hope Tokens**
- Track the groupâ€™s descent or ascent.
- Hope tokens may be spent for rerolls or ritual invocations.

### **Chronicle of Healing**
- Player log of names, locations, and echoes restored.
- Used to reference progress and narratively reshape Jorando.
