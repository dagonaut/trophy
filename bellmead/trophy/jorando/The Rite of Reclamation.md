Notes: The Priests were the vessels to take your grief so you don’t need to hold it. They allowed you memory without the burden. However, the priests and the lake itself started to forget. So they had all this sorrow, but didn’t know why and what their purpose was. So it all got whack.

Create stories that we’re tracking down from the past and they preset Tears/Echos/Memories that are later consumed for the ritual:
 * [[Alaric and Liorna]]
 * The Seer
 * Whomever was last in the [[The Murmuring Cell]] (Reps the Cistern, discovering the secret passage will allow for the finding of his Echo)
 * Someone in the Church - New Priest-who dis? (he was a link between the Church and Evershade). His echo could be found as early as WM
 

Each area needs a story like this that can be used. They all have a puzzle/gimmick to put them to rest and get the echo.

Each boss drops an Echo (like a boss soul)

You gotta choose between the Reliquary going to the people that hire you or the Reclamation.


_"To unmake what sorrow hath made, one must mourn in reverse—remembering joy, restoring names, reassembling what was hollowed."_  —Inscription found on the *Fragment of the First Tear*

## Three Pillars of Reclamation

A multi-set restoration mechanic intended to reverse the corruption of Jorando and return it to a place where sorrow can be relieved, not compounded. 

### 1. **The Recollection of True Names**

_"When the lake forgot the names of those who wept into it, the sorrow had no anchor—and so it grew monstrous."_

**Mechanics:**
- Recover and restore the **True Names** of those lost to the lake and time.
- Names are found in fragments, relics, whispered through spirits, or recorded in fading texts.
- These can be represented by Echo items. 

Items/Echoes:
- **Scroll of Forgotten Kin** ([[Evershade]]): Use at shrines to recover names and illuminate memories.
- **Saint’s Ledger** (Ruined Church): Encoded entries reveal names, can be used to weaken the [[Cursed Hollowed Saints]] .
- **Name of the Lost** (Weeping Well): Speak the Seer's name aloud to gain her Echo.

**Echo Sources:**
 * Alaric and Liorna -EV
 * The Last Pilgrim -EV
 * The Seer -WW
 * Whomever was last in the [[The Murmuring Cell]] -WW
 * Someone in the Church
 * The Priest’s Jaw or something in the Silt Circle or Mourning Stones -WM

### 2. **The Cleansing of Waters**

_"The lake was pure once—fed not by tears of despair, but by those willingly given, as part of a rite to heal."_

**Mechanics:**
- Cleanse corrupted water sources ([[Lake of Tears]], [[The Cistern]]) using relics, prayers, or rites.
- Purification brings clarity and de-aggros enemies.

Items/Echoes:
- **Vial of Blessed Silt** (Cistern): Sprinkle into corrupted pools to suppress sorrowful effects.
- **Drowned Roots** (Whispering Marshes): Burn while reciting a chant found in one of the Book/Tome items.
- **Hymnal of the Lost** (Ruined Church): In a foreign language, must be sung cleanse lakewater. Lore connection to The Messenger?

### 3. **Restore the Choir**

_"The sorrow will only warp Jorando when there is no one to hold vigil."_
_"As a final act of compassion, [[Father Lorian]] committed his soul to the Lake--forever holding vigil."_

**Mechanics:**
- Release [[Father Lorian]]'s soul from the [[Reliquary of the Hollowed Saints]]
