### Rings (of Gods, Travelers, Demons, and Saints)

**1) Ring of the Hollowed Choir (saint)**  
A plain iron band set with three flecks of blue glass that hum faintly when hymns are sung.  
_“Their mouths open—no sound comes.”_  
**Effect:** Silences the **Choir Wailers** in the nave; they cannot raise an alarm while the ring is shown.

**2) Band of the Weeping Bride (traveler)**  
Dented silver, engraved inside with two names washed nearly smooth by tears.  
_“Love is a lantern in dark stone.”_  
**Effect:** When pressed to damp stone in the church, reveals the nearest concealed seam—treat as a **Path** to the **Hidden Tunnel / Weeping Well**.

**3) Signet of Anweald’s Edict (god)**  
Heavy iron with a square face stamped in broken authority sigils.  
_“Doors remember the old command.”_  
**Effect:** Counts as a **Key** for barred church doors (sacristy, bishop’s cage, archive chests).

**4) Thorn-Mother’s Circlet (demon)**  
A narrow band braided like bramble. It pricks the skin but never bleeds.  
_“All nests welcome their own.”_  
**Effect:** The **Ragwing Host** will not attack you unless you draw blood.

**5) Officiant’s Iron (saint)**  
A simple grey ring warmed by the altar’s touch.  
_“Speak it before witnesses, and let the saints bind it.”_  
**Effect:** Vows sworn on the high altar while this ring rests upon it become binding; breaking one draws the **Hollowed Saints** to the oath-breaker.

**6) Rafter-Walker’s Loop (traveler)**  
Hammered copper scuffed with tar and dust.  
_“Up where the bats keep counsel.”_  
**Effect:** Grants a safe **Path** to the **Choir Loft / rafters** without triggering floor hazards below.

**7) Ring of the Droplet (saint)**  
A crystal bead set into brass, forever holding a single tear.  
_“Mercy leaks from the crack, if you know how to catch it.”_  
**Effect:** While displayed, **church spirits** (saints’ shades, mourners) are **Weakened (–4)**.

**8) Drowned King’s Sign (god)**  
Verdigrised bronze etched with wave marks. Cold to the tongue.  
_“Where the hymn sinks, follow.”_  
**Effect:** When dipped in the church font, reveals a descending route—treat as a **Path** to the **Cistern**.

**9) Ring of the Last Penitent (traveler)**  
Iron circlet scratched with tally marks around the band.  
_“Steps counted, sins counted.”_  
**Effect:** You may pass the nave’s **bellwire alarms** and glass-scatter traps without triggering them.

**10) Demon’s Eye (demon)**  
Brass set with a cloudy agate that seems to look back.  
_“Seen as we are seen.”_  
**Effect:** The church’s **binding sigils** that hold demons do not affect the wearer.
