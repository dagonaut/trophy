Though not a Priest of the Hollowed Church, he acted as a liaison between them and the Village [[Evershade]]. He had lived in the village for a long time and was a figure of leadership and solace, and a soothsayer when things started to change. He was among the first to recognize that the waters of [[Lake of Tears]] were corrupting and warned the people of the imminent danger. 


_”It is said, no one is truly dead, until there is no one to remember you. The lake remembers.”_

_”Lorian’s mission was to alleviate the world of suffering. All he did was find a way to put it in a concentrated form.”_ —[[Tears of Lacrimara]] quote?

[[The Hollowed Saint]]


Long before the Reliquary, before the church on the island rose from stone, there was a man named **Father Lorian** (or perhaps his true name is forgotten, and the tapestry’s face is all that remains). He was a village priest in a time of famine and grief, when every family buried more children than it raised. He could not stand to see sorrow consume those around him, and so he began a ritual of listening—_truly_ listening. Each night, he would sit among the mourners, and ask them to speak their pain aloud. He would then pray, _“Let your grief be mine.”_

At first it was metaphor. But as the nights went on, something unnatural stirred. He found that he could take a sliver of grief from another and bear it in himself. The widow who came to him could smile again after years of weeping. The soldier who confessed his sins felt lighter. Yet Lorian’s hair grew white before its time. His frame bent under invisible weight. His eyes became distant, as if haunted by a thousand ghosts.

The people began to call him the **Hollowed Saint**, for he hollowed himself out to hold the grief of others. Pilgrims traveled to him, desperate to be unburdened. And still he said, _“Let it be mine instead.”_

When he finally collapsed, he died smiling, whispering words no one heard clearly. Some say he saw a vision of heaven opening for him; others, that he saw only the bottomless well of human sorrow yawning wider still. His followers interred his bones with reverence and took up his practice. They built shrines, then churches, and finally the great cathedral. They sang the hymns he taught, believing that in emptying themselves of joy they could make a world free of grief.

But Lorian had never intended for others to follow. His gift was rare, and his curse unique. What in him was benevolence became, in his successors, _ritualized austerity_. The Order of the Hollowed Saints was founded not on his vision of healing, but on the husk of his suffering.

_"I opened my arms to hold their grief, but in the end I held only silence." – Last words attributed to Father Lorian, the First Hollowed Saint_
