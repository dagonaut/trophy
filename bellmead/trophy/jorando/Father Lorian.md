Though not a Priest of the Hollowed Church, he acted as a liaison between them and the Village [[Evershade]]. He had lived in the village for a long time and was a figure of leadership and solace, and a soothsayer when things started to change. He was among the first to recognize that the waters of [[Lake of Tears]] were corrupting and warned the people of the imminent danger. 


_”It is said, no one is truly dead, until there is no one to remember you. The lake remembers.”_

_”Lorian’s mission was to alleviate the world of suffering. All he did was find a way to put it in a concentrated form.”_ —[[Tears of Lacrimara]] quote?

[[The Hollowed Saint]]
