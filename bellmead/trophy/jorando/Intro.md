You have debts. There is one in particular that plagues you, that can't be paid with treasure alone. A benefactor has contacted you and offered to pay your debt (whatever it is) if you go to the cursed area Jorando and retrieve the Reliquary of the Hollowed Saints. What is inside is none of your concern, return it unopened and you will all have your debts paid. 

Bonfire refresh... this didn't happen before. Is this a product of Jorando or some magicks that the benefactor has bestowed upon you.

When [[The Shattered Legion]] is first introduced ask them what they know about it. Tell them about the Sundering & [[Rhaskor]]. 


_**“Jorando is a land where sorrow does not fade—it lingers, festers, and devours.”**_

_The land of **Jorando** is drowned in sorrow. Once, pilgrims came here to weep their burdens into the **[[Lake of Tears]]**, leaving their burdens in the care of the Hollowed Saints. But grief lingers, and what was meant to heal has only festered. The saints hollowed themselves, and in their devotion became husks bound to grief and ruin._

_The villages have crumbled. The bridges rot above black waters. The marshes whisper with voices that know your name. All around are remnants of faith twisted by despair: shrines that weep, bells that toll without a hand, graves that do not keep the dead still._

_Travelers now come to Jorando not for solace, but for what might be scavenged from its wreck. Treasures lie buried with faded saints and drowned kings, relics steeped in sorrow yet touched with power. Few who enter return whole._

_And in the shadows wander those broken by war—**[[The Shattered Legion]]**—their banners lost, their purpose confused, but their cruelty sharpened by grief._

_Whether you have come to Jorando, by choice or by chance. Here, sorrow has teeth. What will it take from you? And what will you take from it?_
