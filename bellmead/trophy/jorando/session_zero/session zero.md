* Build toons
* Ask questions
* Sample combat/activity
* A memento of your sorrow & what have you lost

Burdens, Conditions, Ruin, Rolls.


Notes from Trophy Podcast:

This is video gamey. There will be writers room elements where we break kayfabe and talk about gamey elements. 

Bonfire rules:
* If you die you respawn at the bonfire (the last or the next), but only when everyone sits (or the beginning of the next session).
* Lose all your hunt tokens, treasure, and reset your ruin (keep items, be them story or otherwise)

A wealthy benefactor has assembled a team to head to the ruined region of Jorando to recover the Reliquary of the Hollowed Saints. 
Each member of the team has been chosen for a reason, what is that?
Everyone is in debt to the benefactor? What is your debt?
Everyone has an item that is a memento/symbol of loss or sorrow. What is it?

Some notes about the world:


You are on a ship headed toward Jorando. The going is slow as there is little tide or wind to help you along your way, yet the boat is always moving forward. There is a dense fog that parts briefly, you see shadows of movement. Eventually the fog lifts enough to see you are traveling through a bog, your movement has slowed to a crawl and eventually a stop. 


### **Session Zero Voyage: “The Ferry to Sorrow”**

### **Opening Scene: The Crossing**

The party is aboard a small, creaking vessel cutting across the black waters of the Lake of Tears. Mist curls low. Their benefactor is not with them—only a silent ferryman, who never meets their eyes. The lake reflects not the moon, but their own desperation.

This first evening, having a temporary reprieve from their burdens, they pass around a bottle of spirits (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">what kind?</span>) and tell stories of woe, triumph, and ribaldry. All passing sometime in the night. 

==**Prompt:** “What detail about the boat shows it is ill-prepared for this voyage?”==

### Set Goals:
* Arrive at the shores of Jorando... alive.
* Learn about the History of Jorando and the Hollowed Saints.


### **Act I – Strange Happenings**

1. **Echoing Whispers**
    
    - The fog whispers their names, or voices of loved ones, beckoning them overboard.
        
    - **Risk Roll:** Resist being lured into leaning too far (falling into the water), or hush the voices before they spread panic.
        
    - _Consequence for failure:_ A character tumbles into the water or the fog grows thicker, obscuring what lies ahead.
        
2. **The Drowned Cargo**
    
    - The boat lists—waterlogged crates slide loose. Inside: broken saint statues, rusted reliquaries, and sodden journals.
        
    - **Hunt Roll:** Searching through this mess could yield a useful **starting treasure** (perhaps a **Cracked Saint’s Relic** or a **Tear-Stained Chalice**).
        
    - _Twist:_ The relic whispers sorrow into their mind. Do they keep it?
        
3. **Environmental Threat: The Waters Rise**
    
    - A sudden swell strikes the boat—black water floods the deck.
        
    - **Risk Roll:** Bail water or keep footing on the slick deck.
        
    - _Consequence for failure:_ The boat takes on more water, reducing time before disaster.

## **Act II – The Compromise**

1. **The Hull Splits**
    
    - Something scrapes beneath the boat—barnacles and teeth, maybe the echo of the Drowned King’s curse.
        
    - A hole opens below the waterline.
        
    - **Risk Roll:** Plug or brace the breach before the boat floods.
        
    - _Consequence for failure:_ Characters are separated or dragged toward the hole.
        
2. **The Attack**
    
    - From the black water, the **Drowned Dead** (lesser thralls of the Drowned King) climb aboard.
        
    - **Combat Roll:** Fight them off while the boat groans and sinks.
        
    - Flavor: Their touch leaves brackish stains; their eyes glow faintly green.
        
3. **Twist Option:** Instead of the Drowned Dead, a single **Bog Wraith** (scaled down for Session Zero) bursts from the water, trying to drag someone under.

## **Act III – The Escape**

1. **Abandon Ship**
    
    - The boat is sinking. The ferryman vanishes, slipping into the mist. The adventurers must leap or row to the shore of Jorando.
        
    - **Risk Roll:** Navigate the surf or swim through debris to the shore.
        
    - _Consequence for failure:_ Arrive exhausted, soaked, and lose something of value to the lake.
        
2. **Closing Image**
    
    - They collapse on the shore. Behind them, the boat sinks, pulled under by unseen hands. Ahead: the misty silhouette of the **Whispering Marshes**.
        
    - The benefactor’s voice lingers in memory: _“Retrieve the Reliquary, or your sorrows will never be lifted.”_

#### **Drowned Dead**

_Shambling Undead Sailors — 6/7/8 (number appearing)

**Appearance:**  
Once human, their bloated bodies are mottled blue and grey, wrapped in ragged clothes that drip with murkwater. Eyes glow faint green; mouths are full of brackish silt. They move slowly but with relentless intent.

**Abilities/Defences:**
- **Clinging Hands:** On a hit, drag a target down or pin them. Target must succeed on a Risk Roll to break free.

**Weakness:**  Fire  

**Behavior (d6):**
1. Lurch toward the living.      
2. Mutter drowned prayers in bubbles of water.      
3. Reach for the living with yearning hands.      
4. Stare into reflections instead of fighting.      
5. Drop sodden keepsakes of their past life.      
6. Collapse into water only to rise again moments later.

#### **Bog Wraith**

_Amphibious Predator — 10

**Appearance:**  
A sinewy, amphibious beast rising from the lake. Its body is slick with algae and muck, glowing eyes like twin lanterns in the mist. Its claws are long, spindly, and too many.

**Abilities/Defenses:**  
- **Tendril Snare:** On a hit, pull a character or their gear into the water. They must Risk Roll to avoid being submerged.      

**Weakness:**  
Bound to the water — grows sluggish if forced onto dry land.

**Behavior (d6):**  
1. Circles just beneath the surface, waiting.      
2. Mimics a drowning cry to lure rescuers.      
3. Snaps at lantern light, trying to extinguish it.      
4. Leaves behind slick trails of algae.      
5. Retreats if struck with iron or salt.      
6. Gurgles in a voice not its own — an echo of past victims.
