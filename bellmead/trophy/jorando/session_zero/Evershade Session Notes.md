- [ ] [[Aram (Brad)]] now has a condition: haunted. The toasting father is staying with him
- [ ] [[Vero (Pete)]] added the [[Marrow Cling]] to the Crown of the Drowned King; he failed his roll in trying to make it do anything, but as a result of the Devil's bargain, it is not attached to his head/face.
