Endurance (12)

_The collective sorrow of the saints given shape—shimmering, semi-transparent, stitched from tears and prayers. It assumes familiar silhouettes to each witness._  

**Special Moves:**
- **Griefwave:** A pulse of sadness forces visions of personal loss; on failure, lose your next action to mourning. Gain condition: Grief-stricken     
- **Echoform:** Takes the shape of one you mourn; attacks you with their last words.      
- **Liturgy of Undertow:** The water itself obeys.

**Weaknesses:**    
- **Still Surface:** Cannot be harmed unless the water is still. Freeze, salt, or mechanically still the pool (Overflow Tunnel valve; Saints’ Reflection Pool relic).      
- **Dry Relic / Fire:** Takes extra harm from items not yet touched by the lake (relics kept dry), open flame, or the **Sacrificial Dagger** during a rite.      
- **Reconciled Heart:** A character who has made peace with a grief can “hold” the Echo in their reflection for one turn, exposing it.  

**Dry the Heart** used in lore to point to the Still Surface and Dry Relic weaknesses
