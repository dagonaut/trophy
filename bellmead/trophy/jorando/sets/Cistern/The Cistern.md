_The Cistern is a place of dangerous reverence. Its waters remember everything. Its silence is never empty._


Beneath the split flagstones of the Ruined Church lies the cistern: a once-holy reservoir now drowned in sanctified corruption. Pilgrims once descended these dripping stairs to draw water blessed by the Hollowed Saints, believing it could soothe grief and scour sickness. But the Lake of Tears seeped into its foundations, and the saints—desperate, faithful, frightened—blended sacred rites with the lake’s sorrow. The water grew heavy and still. It began to mirror regret more readily than faces, and the stone learned to listen. Now the cistern reflects not grace but grief. The chambers hum with low hymns that have forgotten their words. Bones kneel in prayer that never ends. Every ripple carries a memory, whether you want it or not. The cistern does not forgive; it keeps.

## Goal

- Explore the cistern to uncover remnants of sacred rites.    
- Withstand its emotional and spiritual corruption.    
- Discover the passage that leads toward the deeper roots of the Lake (reclamation).    
- **Objective:** Reach the depths of the cistern and cleanse or claim its heart.    
- **Discover:** What became of the final saints who performed the forbidden rites.    
- **Complication:** Any who touch the water risk the slow onset of the Hollowing Curse.    

---

## Moments

- A ripple in the water mirrors your past, not your reflection.    
- A soft chant echoes as if from inside the walls.    
- The air turns cold when you speak your name aloud.    
- A drowned priest speaks in bubbles from beneath the surface.    
- A seal etched into the wall glows when sorrow is spoken aloud.    
- A ripple moves opposite to your step.    
- A broken mask floats on the surface of the cistern.    

---

## Questions

- What memory returns to you when you see your reflection here?    
- What part of you feels at home in the sorrow?    
- What do you carry that might purify these waters—or worsen them?    
- What pain would you trade away if you could?    
- Who among you carries a vial of the church’s water from before it was corrupted?    
- What vision of grief seizes you when you hear the water stir?

## The Hollowing Curse (Set Rule)

**Three tiers of exposure:**

- **Touch (scene):** Skin contact or splashes mark **Hollowing (Touch)**. Until the scene ends, roll with disadvantage to resist despair/echo effects. Cleansed by intact salt circles, the Mitre (while active), or a true confession at the Altar.
    
- **Drink (delve):** A measured draught grants its listed boon **and** you gain **1 Burden: Thirst for Lament**. While marked, the first failed resistance each scene also erases a pleasant memory (returns when cleansed). Cleanse at the Altar (purify path) or by using a **Coin of Release**.
    
- **Immerse (persistent):** Submersion marks **Hollowing (Major)**. Each time you speak your name, weep, or take a Ruin/Wear die here, advance a 3‑tick **Hollowing clock**. At 3 ticks, you draw the Wailbound or briefly take on their traits (GM move) until someone steadies you. Only the Lake’s rite or an exorcism using a **Dry Reliquary Shard** removes it.

## Locations / Events

### 1) The Overflow Tunnel

Originally a maintenance shaft, now a suffocating passage of wet stone and lingering prayers.

- **Event:** Water flows uphill while voices chant your name.
    
- **Trap:** A sudden reverse surge pins a character in place until another speaks a name they regret.
    
- **Opportunity:** A corroded valve wheel can be jammed to still the waters elsewhere (see Boss Weakness).
    
- **Treasure:** **Sorrowbound Key** hidden in a wall niche.
    

### 2) Sanctum of Salt

Salt lines and dissolved relics mark a failed exorcism.

- **Prop:** Symbols of many forgotten faiths burned into the floor.
    
- **Trap:** Hallucinations overwhelm those who break the salt lines; each sees a different absolution offered at a terrible cost.
    
- **Opportunity:** Re-complete the circle with fresh salt (or bone ash) to create a temporary ward.
    
- **Treasure:** **Tarnished Prayer Beads** tangled around a rusted thurible.
    

### 3) The Saints’ Reflection Pool

A shallow basin where spectral saints silently observe—faces eroded by time and tears.

- **Event:** One tries to speak a name from someone’s backstory; on acceptance, gain guidance; on refusal, gain a Burden.
    
- **Challenge:** Drinking here shows the path ahead, but the drinker forgets a pleasant memory until the delve ends.
    
- **Opportunity:** Place a _dry_ relic upon the water to briefly still the surface (see Boss Weakness).
    
- **Treasure:** **Saint’s Fragment** wedged in the lip of the basin.
    

### 4) The Bone Grate

A rusted iron grate blocks deeper tunnels. Skulls are stacked behind it like offerings.

- **Lore:** The last saint cast themselves into the water here; their mask is missing.
    
- **Challenge:** The grate will open only when a name is whispered that the speakers never shared in life.
    
- **Treasure:** **Fragment of Lacrimara** wedged between ribs, cold to the touch.
    

### 5) The Spiral Descent

A narrow stair spiraling downward, slick with condensation.

- **Challenge:** Slippery steps and mournful echoes that disorient.
    
- **Opportunity:** Etched prayers on the walls can be traced to ward spirits for one scene.
    
- **Encounter:** **Wailbound Acolytes** performing a drowned rite.
    

### 6) Sanctified Reservoir (Heart Pool)

A broad chamber where sorrow-tainted water gathers.

- **Challenge:** The water reflects each adventurer’s regrets, sapping will (roll with disadvantage to resist despair).
    
- **Opportunity:** Drinking a measured draught (teaspoon, not cup) reveals a memory not your own—usable once as a clue die.
    
- **Event:** A whisper travels across the surface repeating something only one character knows; following the sound reveals a hidden relief valve.
    

### 7) Altar of Blended Waters

A crumbling dais where the saints performed their last rites.

- **Challenge:** Residual magic lashes out in waves of despair.
    
- **Opportunity (Purify/Profane):** Complete a rite with either clean water and a confession (purify) or lake-water and a denial (empower). Either course changes the boss.
    
- **Treasure:** **Hollowed Relic** beneath a slate tile; **Waterskin of Cursed Water** hanging from a hook.
    

### 8) Chamber of Hollowed Bones

The resting place of the final saints. Bones carefully arranged in prayer.

- **Challenge:** Spirits stir if disturbed—or if sorrow overwhelms the party.
    
- **Opportunity:** One saint’s headpiece remains intact; wearing it suppresses the curse for a time.
    
- **Treasure:** **Mitre of the Weeping Saint** (see Items); **Sorrowblade** in a reliquary drawer.

## Boss: The Weeping Echo (Saint-Collective)

**Description:** The collective sorrow of the saints given shape—shimmering, semi-transparent, stitched from tears and prayers. It assumes familiar silhouettes to each witness.  
**Special Moves:**

- **Griefwave:** A pulse of sadness forces visions of personal loss; on failure, lose your next action to mourning.
    
- **Echoform:** Takes the shape of one you mourn; attacks you with their last words.
    
- **Liturgy of Undertow:** The water itself obeys; each round the water level rises or falls precipitously.  
    **Weaknesses:**
    
- **Still Surface:** Cannot be harmed unless the water is still. Freeze, salt, or mechanically still the pool (Overflow Tunnel valve; Saints’ Reflection Pool relic).
    
- **Dry Relic / Fire:** Takes extra harm from items not yet touched by the lake (relics kept dry), open flame, or the **Sacrificial Dagger** during a rite.
    
- **Reconciled Heart (Optional Subversion):** A character who has made peace with a grief can “hold” the Echo in their reflection for one turn, exposing it.  
    **Treasure:**
    
- If the Echo is **Purified** at the Altar: **Coin of Release** + **Reliquary Tear**.
    
- If the Echo is **Empowered** (profane rite): **Veil of the Weeping Echo** + **Ring of Echoes**.
    

**Reliquary Rule (Church standard):** Boss rewards are sealed and **must be kept dry**. If they are wetted by lake-water, flip to a **Wept** state (listed drawback applies) until ritually dried at the Church or by spending a confession.

**Reward details:**

- **Veil of the Weeping Echo (Wept: whispers linger)** — _Peek a heartbeat ahead._ Once per scene, ask “What sorrow comes next?” and gain advantage on a related roll; then mark 1 whisper. At 3 whispers, the GM may echo one of your past laments aloud.
    
- **Ring of Echoes (Wept: takes your words)** — _Bind a memory._ Imprint a short phrase from a foe you heard here; 1×/delve, speak it to force hesitation or open a passage that responds to that phrase. If Wept, the ring sometimes speaks **your** words back at the worst moment.
    
- **Coin of Release (Wept: melts to slag)** — _Spend to let go._ One‑use: remove one Burden or clear **Hollowing (Drink)** from a willing target. If Wept, the coin dissolves after use and leaves a faint burn.
    
- **Reliquary Tear (Wept: invites undertow)** — _Part sorrowful waters once._ One‑use miracle: stills and parts a pool/flow in this set; counts as a **dry relic** vs. the boss. If Wept, the water surges back a moment sooner, imposing a scramble.
