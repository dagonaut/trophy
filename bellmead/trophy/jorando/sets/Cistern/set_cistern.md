**SET: THE CISTERN BENEATH THE RUINED CHURCH OF THE HOLLOWED SAINTS**

---

*The Cistern is a place of dangerous reverence. Its waters remember everything. Its silence is never empty.*

###  Intro

Once a sacred reservoir beneath the church, the cistern stored water said to cleanse the soul and ward off darkness. Now, after centuries of corruption, it holds only sorrow. The Lake of Tears seeped into its depths, warping the holy water and transforming the cistern into a vessel of grief and memory. Saints once purified pilgrims here; now they whisper curses in the dark. The space echoes with the burden of centuries, soaked in both sanctity and despair.

Beneath the cracked stone floors of the Ruined Church lies the cistern: a once-holy chamber now drowned in sanctified corruption. Carved into the earth as a reservoir for sacred water, the cistern was once blessed by the Hollowed Saints themselves. Pilgrims would descend to draw healing waters, believed to protect against grief and disease. But with the taint of the Lake of Tears, that purity twisted. The water grew still, heavy with sorrow. Saints wept into the pool, and their despair rooted into the stone. Now the cistern reflects not grace, but grief, a mirror to the fall of faith.

### Goal
- Explore the cistern to uncover remnants of sacred rites.
- Withstand its emotional and spiritual corruption.
- Discover the passage beneath that leads toward the deeper roots of the Lake (reclamation)
- **Objective**: Reach the depths of the cistern and cleanse or claim its heart.
- **Discover**: What became of the final saints who performed the forbidden rites.
- **Complication**: Any who touch the water risk the slow onset of the Hollowing Curse.

- **To the Lake** via a flooded passage revealed only during low tide.
- **Subversion**: Let a single character take the grief of all, allowing others to pass.
