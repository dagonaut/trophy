*The Whispering Marshes sprawl with unnatural stillness, where the air is thick with fog and sorrow. Once a fertile expanse, the land now chokes on brackish water and creeping vines. The fog whispers secrets—some true, some unkind—feeding on the grief of any who linger. It is a place of transition, between the realms of the living and the dead, between memory and forgetting.*

*Travelers avoid the marshes, claiming that those who enter often forget why they came—or who they were. Strange flowers bloom in silence, and the mud seems to suck at boots with a mind of its own. This is a place where sorrows echo. It is said the dead rise here not out of vengeance, but confusion, trying to finish lives long faded.*

The Whispering Marshes are a vast expanse of mist-covered wetlands surrounding the approach to [[Evershade]]. The ground is soft and treacherous, with twisted trees rising from the murky waters, their roots exposed like grasping fingers. The air is thick with fog and the distant sound of whispered voices, barely discernible and impossible to locate. These whispers seem to come from all directions, filling the players with a sense of unease and foreboding.

### Goals:
- Navigate the treacherous path(s) to find The Abandoned Village: [[Evershade]]
- Uncover hints of the deeper mysteries and sorrows that plague Jorando
- Recover something lost—physically or emotionally.
- Avoid being consumed by the whispering fog.

### Questions/Paint the Scene:
* What sorrow brought you to the marshes?
- What does the fog whisper to you?
- What did you bury here long ago?
- What do you see that let’s you know your sorrows have followed you here

### Moments:
- The fog is thick, reducing visibility to only a few feet, and the air is heavy with the scent of decay and stagnant water.    
- The haunting whispers revealing cryptic hints about Jorando and its past.

- Note Found: _“The air grows thick with sorrow, heavier each day. The lake no longer reflects the light; it only swallows it whole. The whispers speak of a reckoning, of shadows creeping from the marshes, of saints no longer hallowed but truly hollow. The tears will drown more than just our hopes. May the gods have mercy on our souls.”_ -[[Father Lorian]]
- The Wailing Spirit - an ethereal spirit stuck between worlds--it entices you, but to what end?  
- You are wet all over. While chilly, the dampness is like humidity.  
- A flower blooms as if watching the party pass.  
- A corpse speaks a memory that belongs to someone in the group.  
- The fog clears just enough to reveal a glimpse of a forgotten ruin, then closes again.  
- The fog splits, revealing a drowned village beneath the water - a mirage or a prophecy?    
- A Drowned King’s shadow passes overhead.  
- A fetid bloom releases spores that force hallucinations.  

### Weeping Shade Appearance

### Locations / Traps / Opportunities:

##### [[The Shrouded Path]]: 
A narrow, winding trail of firmer ground that leads through the marshes; the ostensible path to [[Evershade]]. It is lined with ancient, moss-covered stones, some of which bear strange symbols that glow faintly in the mist.  
* The Wailing Wisps: Ghostly, pale lights that float just above the marsh's surface, leading travelers off the Path, deeper into the marshes towards [[The Bog Heart]] and away from safety. Those who follow them find themselves lost in the fog, surrounded by the whispering voices of the marsh. **Usually a precursor to another are or [[Lantern Maw]]**.  
* The Bog Heart, where you are led, is a good place to harvest [[Feyheart Blossom]].  

##### [[The Mourning Stones]]: 
Large, upright stones scattered throughout the marsh, etched with ancient carvings that tell of the sorrow and despair that plagues the land. Touching one of these stones can reveal a brief vision of the past, showing the players glimpses of the tragedy that befell Jorando.

* <span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">Remind them of the sorrowful nature of the environment</span>  
* On a failure, you see a sign of your own fate, it is not good. Take the condition: Memento Mori  

##### [[The Silt Circle]]: 
Hidden among the reeds and fog there is an ancient ritual site. The site is marked by faded glyphs, weathered altars, and scattered relics of a bygone era. Strange symbols are etched into the ground and the air feels charged with residual magic.  
* [[Priests Jaw Bone]]  
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">What do you see?</span>  
* <span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">GM note: what does it summon/trigger/do?</span>  

##### [[The Bog Heart]]
