**Grotesque Marsh Insect – CR 7**

**Physical Description:**
A bloated, carapaced insect the size of a hound, its back split open into a nest of writhing feelers and twitching legs. Milky, lidless eyes scan ceaselessly, and its mandibles drip with reeking bile. Its belly is translucent, revealing smaller larvae pulsing within.

**Abilities:**
- **Web-Egg Bomb:** Launches a sac that bursts into acidic webs; immobilizes and burns armor/flesh.
- **Piercing Mandibles:** Injects numbing venom; untreated wounds may hatch larvae.

**Weakness:** Vulnerable to fire; softens under sustained heat.
