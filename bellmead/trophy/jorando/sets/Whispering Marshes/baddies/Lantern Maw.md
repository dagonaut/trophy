Wraith - CR 6

**Physical Description:**
A bloated, semi-transparent swamp wraith with a glowing moss-lantern fused into its chest. Its face is stretched into a permanent scream, and spectral limbs drift in and out of its shifting form like trailing smoke.

**Weakness:**
The Lantern Maw is bound to light—strong sources of fire or focused light briefly banish its limbs, making it vulnerable to attack.

**Attacks:**
- **Glowlash** – The Lantern Maw whips a luminous tendril of mosslight toward a target. On hit, it wraps around the victim’s eyes and mouth, blinding and silencing them.    
- **Swallowing Gloom** – The creature lets out a pulse of shadow that snuffs out all light sources nearby and pulls victims 10 feet closer, leaving them disoriented.

**Drops**:
[[Glowmoss Lantern]]

| 1   | Hovering silently above a recently extinguished campfire, absorbing its warmth.                                |
| 2   | Mimicking the flicker of a Glowmoss Lantern to lure wanderers into a deep bog.                                 |
| 3   | Whispering memories in the voice of a lost loved one, trying to lure someone closer.                           |
| 4   | Floating just above the surface of a blackwater pool, drawing spirits from below.                              |
| 5   | Surrounded by the still-burning lights of the Glowmoss Lanterns it has consumed.                               |
| 6   | Flickering erratically, caught between this world and another, shrieking as it phases in and out of existence. |
