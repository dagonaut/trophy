Journal will contain a note on both where to find it and the combination.

Hints to combine with [[Glowmoss Lantern]]:
_"When the dead preach by borrowed light, the king shall remember his guilt."_
_"Bind the tongue of the fallen priest to the lantern’s glow, and drown not—but be heard."_
_"Only by lighting the forgotten sermon can his sorrow take form."_
_"The light alone he does not fear, but give it a voice, and he will tremble."_
_"What was said in death must be shown in light. Only then will the drowned turn their gaze."_
