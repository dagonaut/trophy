![[wm-marrow cling.webp|300]]
*A dark, irregular cluster of parasitic barnacles, faintly pulsing with life.*

*"Its vitality is yours, but it takes more than it gives."*

**Effect:** Use in crafting a strength potion (gain a 3rd dark die on an attack roll). Gain 1 Ruin.

Additional:
It's a small, parasitic organism that resembles a cluster of twisted, dark gray growths clinging to rocks, trees, and other surfaces in the marsh. Unlike barnacles, which are stationary, Marrow Clings have a faint pulsating motion, as if they are slowly contracting and expanding. Their surface is rough and leathery, covered in tiny, hair-like tendrils that grasp onto anything they touch. 

**If attached, you become lethargic and more susceptible to enemies... specifically [[Lantern Maw]]**

**Behavior**: Latch onto living beings and drain vitality over time.

**Harvesting**: The tendrils of a Marrow Cling can be used in alchemy to create vitality potions, but extracting them is dangerous.
