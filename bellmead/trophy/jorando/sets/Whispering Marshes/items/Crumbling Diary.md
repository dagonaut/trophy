_A decayed leather-bound journal with brittle pages and water-damaged ink. The entries begin mundane—farm yields, family names—before spiraling into fragmented warnings and pleas scratched in haste._

_"The well… the bells won’t stop… I saw the stone move. Gods forgive me, I looked inside."_

**Effect:**  
Spout Lore. The diary reveals secrets about the Weeping Well, the Stone Sentinel, and the Reclamation puzzle.

Other Quotes:
**Option 1 (unraveling mind):**  
_"I thought writing it down would help me remember. But now the words change when I’m not looking."_

**Option 2 (haunted guilt):**  
_"They begged me not to go near the well. I told them I wouldn’t. I lied."_

**Option 3 (ominous foresight):**  
_"Something is clawing its way up. And we keep digging."_

**Option 4 (resigned dread):**  
_"It doesn’t matter what we write. The ink runs. The pages rot. The end always finds us."_

**Stone Sentinel**:
“...we tried everything—blade, fire, blessed ash. Nothing broke its stride.  
But then old Reth swung wild and low—his hammer cracked it just _so_.  
A flicker in the chest, a pulse like light under moss...  
It staggered.

Only then did we see it wasn’t invincible—just stubborn.

The crack isn’t always there. But when it _opens_—like a breath drawn in stone—  
strike not with anger, but with timing.”
