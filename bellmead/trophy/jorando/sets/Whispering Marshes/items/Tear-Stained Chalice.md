**This effect works best in the Weeping Well**

_An ancient silver chalice, blackened with tarnish and lined with violet mineral residue. When tilted, the liquid inside clings unnaturally to the rim, as if reluctant to part—its surface rippling with unseen sorrow._

_"One sip, and you’ll be safe… but not untouched."_
_“He who drinks weeps not for others, but for his own forgotten wounds.”_

**Effect:**  
Grants temporary immunity to curses for one scene. Afterwards, the bearer is overcome with despair, gaining the condition: despair until they rest. Overuse can lead to Ruin.
