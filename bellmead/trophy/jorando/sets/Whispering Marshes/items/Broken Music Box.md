_A rusted, wind-up music box etched with a cracked heart inside its lid. The melody it plays is faint and uneven—like a memory trying to remember itself._

_"It only plays when no one is listening. That’s when she hears it."_

**Effect:**  
Plays a sorrowful tune that soothes restless spirits. Use to abate the spirit in the [[Weeping Well]].
