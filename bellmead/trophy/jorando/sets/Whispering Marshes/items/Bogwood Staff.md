![[wm-i-bogwood-staff.png|300]]
_A gnarled staff made from the wood of an ancient, drowned tree. Its surface is slick with swarms rot, yet it hums faintly with forgotten magic. It grants the user increased control over water-based magic but is fragile and prone to breaking._

_"Handle it with careâ€”once broken, its magic will flow away like the tide."_

**Effect:** Adds 1 white die to Ritual rolls. Lost if Ruin is taken. Can also be used as a weapon in combat.
