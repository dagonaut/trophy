The scent of lavender clings to it faintly, preserved by some emotional residue rather than time. It is tucked in the drawer of a cracked writing desk in the hollowed ruins beneath the bell tower._

_"It’s just a letter… unless you know where to read it."_

**Effect:**  
Reveals the location of a hidden compartment beneath the Bell Tower. The compartment contains the **Silver Locket of Eternal Vows** and a hidden mural scratched into the stone—an old diagram showing the **Reclamation Ritual**, suggesting it was more than legend. The mural includes a faded symbol matching one carved into the Sentinel’s cracked core.

**My Dearest Liorna,**

The nights grow colder without you by my side, and the shadows in this cursed village grow longer with each passing day. I fear what they say about the lake, but my love for you burns brighter than any fear in my heart.

Meet me where the sun once kissed the stone, where the ivy now hides what we once held dear. Beneath the old bell tower, where our vows were whispered to the winds, I have left something for you—something to remember me by, should the darkness take us both.

Follow the path we walked that autumn day, when the leaves were golden and the world was ours. I’ll wait for you there, in the place where we promised forever.

Yours,**Alaric**
