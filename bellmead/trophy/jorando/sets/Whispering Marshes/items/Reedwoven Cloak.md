*A cloak woven from marsh reeds, blending perfectly with the boggy surroundings. Thieves thought it valuable, until they realized there was nothing to steal but regrets.*

*"They won’t see you coming—but if they do, it won’t save you."*

**Effect:** Grants near invisibility in the marsh but provides little combat protection. On a 6 it can act as armor.
