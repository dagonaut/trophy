The Lake of Tears, once known as **Lacrimara** or the **Lake of Lament**, is a vast, still body of water whose surface reflects not only the sky but the deepest sorrows of any who gaze upon it. Pilgrims once journeyed here to cast away grief, believing the lake would grant them peace. Instead, their tears bound them to its depths, and over centuries the water absorbed their anguish and became a sentient mirror of despair.

### **Goals**

- Discover the truth behind the lake’s sorrowful intelligence.    
- Resist the pull of the water’s grief before it drags you under.    
- Uncover hidden passages or relics beneath the lake’s depths.

### **Questions/Paint The Scene**

- Even in the middle of the day, while on the Lake, it is perpetual dusk. Why?
- What secret grief does the lake reveal when you look into it?
- Who among your party feels the weight of another’s sorrow reflected in the water?    
- What promise or vow would you be willing to relinquish to cross its surface?
- What sound do you hear carried on the wind? 

### **Moments**

- A whisper carried on the breeze echoes the name of someone you’ve lost.    
- The water’s surface ripples, showing not your reflection but a past memory.    
- A lone lantern drifts across the lake, its glow revealing submerged shapes.    
- On a moonless night, the lake shimmers with an inner light, as though lit from below. 

### **Locations / Traps / Opportunities**
- **Submerged Altar**  
    Beneath the lake lies a broken altar to an unnamed deity. Removing a relic may calm the lake’s wrath—or provoke it.
* **Island of Broken Vows**: 
	* Challenge room (island)
	* Location for over-arching reclamation ritual

### **Baddies & Hazards**

* **Gravemare Shades**
	Ghostly figures that emerge from the water, their outstretched hands dragging victims beneath.    
- **Sorrow Eddies**  
    Sudden whirlpools of grief-laden water that pull characters under unless they succeed on a Willpower check.    
- **Hollowed Fish**  
    Schooling fish whose scales mirror the faces of the damned; approaching them invites haunting visions.

### **Unique Flora & Fauna**

- **Tearshell Mollusk**  
    A pale shellfish whose pearls are said to hold condensed grief—harvesting one inflicts a moment of overwhelming sadness.    
- **Sorrow Lily**  
    A black-petaled flower that blooms on stones at the lake’s edge. Its scent soothes Ruin but risks luring spirits.    
- **Reflection Eel**  
    Slender eels that slither over submerged objects, revealing hidden runes when touched.

### **Mysteries & Lore**

- **Origin of Lacrimara:** Some say the lake was born of the Hollowed Saints’ final act of atonement—casting their tears into the abyss only to be bound by them.    
- **Island of Broken Vows:** Legends speak of a small islet at the lake’s center where an ancient temple stands, visible only under the blood moon.    
- **Voice Beneath the Waves:** Travelers whisper of a deep, sung melody that drifts up from the lake bed—a call to those who cannot find peace.
### **Items & Treasures**

    **Effect:** Grants 1 white or black die for one ritual roll; wearer gains 1 Ruin.    
- **Chalice of Mourning**  
    _A silver chalice stained by the lake’s waters._  
    **Effect:** Temporarily negates one physical wound; user gains haunting visions.


### **Way Forward**
