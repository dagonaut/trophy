_Semi-sentient tangle of roots, bone, and sorrow | Challenge Rating: 6 / 9_

_What appears at first to be a rotting tree half-swallowed by graves is, in truth, a coiled mass of animate roots and partial skeletons. Antlers, femurs, and rusted grave markers jut from its bark-like hide. It has no face—only a sunken hollow filled with soil, teeth, and flickering, mossy light. When it stirs, the sound is like a hundred grave markers grinding in unison._

**Abilities:**

- **Entangle the Mourner:**  
    The Gravemind lashes out with barbed roots to ensnare intruders. On a successful hit, it immobilizes a target until they pass a Strength or Wits test. If they fail twice, the Gravemind _feeds_—draining either Resolve or Ruin (player's choice).    
- **Echo Root:**  
    It can mimic sounds of the dead. Once per encounter, it speaks in the voice of someone the character lost—begging for help, forgiveness, or return. Failure to resist causes hesitation or self-inflicted doubt. [[Risk Roll]] and possible condition.    

**Weakness:**  
**The Flame of Memory** — The Gravemind recoils from **true grief freely offered**. Burning a personal memento (e.g., the _Faded Love Letter_ or _Grief-Worn Doll_) in its presence stuns it for one round and strips away its spectral mimicry.
Also fire. Its weak to actual fire.

**Drops:** [[Bogwood Staff]]

**Behavior (d6):**
1. Lies dormant, appearing as part of the graveyard.    
2. Slowly rotates its tangled body toward fresh grief.    
3. Whispers a lost loved one’s name from deep within its trunk.    
4. Opens its root-maw to reveal a buried face, sobbing.    
5. Begins to strangle a nearby gravestone as if in mourning.    
6. Offers up a perfectly preserved object from its core—then retracts violently when touched.!
