### **A Silver Locket**

_A finely wrought silver locket on a delicate chain, tarnished by age yet unbroken. Within, behind a sheet of cracked glass, is a faded portrait of two lovers in a final embrace._

_"Love endures—even when it’s not supposed to."_
_”Love endures—even after it is forgotten.”_
_”Love remembers—even when all else is forgotten.”_

**Effect:**  
When worn near the mural in the bell tower, the locket causes hidden glyphs to reveal themselves—glyphs detailing the Reclamation ritual. It also grants brief resistance to spirit influence while worn. 

Wearing it in the [[The Silent Graveyard]] near [[Liorna]]’s grave triggers her last moment.

The locket is small and intricately crafted, its surface engraved with delicate patterns of entwined vines and flowers. Time has tarnished the silver, but a faint glow emanates from the locket, as if it still holds the warmth of the love that once filled it. Inside, there are two tiny portraits—one of Alaric and the other of Liorna—painted with exquisite detail. Beneath the portraits, folded within the locket, is a dried, pressed flower, the same kind that bloomed in Evershade before the village fell into ruin.

Fun fact: Those flowers still bloom near her grave and the [[The Bell Tower]]

**Properties:**
- **Whisper of the Past:** When held close, the locket allows the wearer to hear faint echoes of conversations and memories from those who once lived in Evershade. This can be used to uncover hidden secrets or gain insight into the village's past.
- **Guiding Light:** In times of danger or darkness, the locket emits a soft, guiding light, illuminating the path ahead and helping the wearer navigate treacherous areas.
- **Bound by Love:** The locket carries a powerful emotional resonance. It grants the wearer resistance to fear-based effects and despair, as it serves as a reminder of love’s enduring strength, even in the face of overwhelming darkness.

**Lore:** The locket was a gift from Alaric to Liora, a symbol of their eternal love and the vows they made to each other. Though they were separated by the tragic events that befell Evershade, the locket remains a testament to their bond, imbued with the lingering essence of their devotion.
