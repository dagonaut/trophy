_Hidden near the village’s outer edge—where stone gives way to mud and ivy—the Forgotten Shrine slouches beneath a collapsed tree. Time has nearly buried it. A single standing column remains, etched with a deity’s sigil worn smooth by centuries of rain and grief. Offerings, long decayed, still cling to the altar: wilted flowers, broken lockets, and bits of cloth once soaked in tears. Despite the ruin, something sacred lingers here… and something watching._

**Questions:**
* <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">What has been offered on the alter?</span>

**Trap / Hazard / Encounter:**
- **Desecration Trigger**: Removing any item from the altar immediately summons **The Last Pilgrim**. They appear behind the shrine with silent fury, attacking without hesitation. If players replace the offering afterward, the Pilgrim’s rage subsides—but only briefly.    
- **Lingering Divinity**: If one attempts a ritual here without proper reverence, the shrine **curses** them. For one scene, their weapons are considered "hollow," unable to affect spirits or guardians. Only performing a **restorative act of faith or mourning** will lift the curse.

**Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing:**
- **Proper Offering**: Placing a meaningful token of grief (like the _Silver Locket_, _Faded Love Letter_, or a personal item tied to backstory) on the altar may do one of the following:    
    - Reveal a **moment of memory**: a vision of the village before it fell, showing the hidden path to the Weeping Well.        
    - Temporarily **calm all spirits** in the area for one scene.        
    - Call forth the Last Pilgrim in a **non-hostile form**, willing to answer one question.        
- **Writ of Forgotten Rites**: Hidden beneath a cracked stone tile at the shrine’s base is a weathered scroll describing **how to sanctify cursed ground**. Useful for subverting the Lake or pacifying the Hollowed Spirits in the Tavern.    
- **Cracked Idol**: A small stone figure buried in the mud behind the shrine. When held during sleep, it causes sorrowful dreams—but grants the user a vision of someone they lost or failed. (Next morning, they may remove 1 Ruin, but lose 1 Resolve.)
