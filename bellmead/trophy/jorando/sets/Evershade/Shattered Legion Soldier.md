_Twisted undead soldier | Challenge Rating: 5-9_

**Appearance:**  
Clad in splintered armor pitted with rust and age, the Shattered Legion Soldier moves with unnerving precision. Bits of bone show through cracked gauntlets, and their eyeless helms leak a faint blue mist. Their tabards bear the faded symbol of a forgotten empire—now more shroud than banner. They march as if still awaiting orders, blades held in trembling readiness.

**Abilities:**
- **Phantom Formation:**  
    Shattered Legion Soldiers fight in eerie coordination. When fighting in pairs, they gain +1 to attack and defense. If one is slain, the survivor goes into a frenzy (+1 to damage but -1 to defense).    
- **Drillmaster’s Echo:**  
    The ghostly voice of their old commander lingers. Once per encounter, they can mimic a tactical shout that forces opponents within earshot to reroll a successful dodge or parry.
    
**Weakness:**  
**Broken Memories** — A soldier falters when shown relics of their former life. Wearing the **Phantom Commander's Sigil** or invoking the name of someone from their past causes hesitation or confusion, making them lose their action for a round.

**Behavior (d6):**
1. Polishes a rusted blade with mechanical care, unaware of its own decay.    
2. Marches in a looping patrol, footsteps perfectly timed with an unseen rhythm.    
3. Stares at a ruined standard, unmoving, until disturbed.    
4. Reenacts a long-forgotten skirmish with invisible enemies.    
5. Offers a half-salute to anything it perceives as an officer.    
6. Murmurs a dying oath—“Hold the line… for the hollowed…”—before drawing steel.
