**Description:**

The Last Pilgrim is a gaunt, enigmatic figure who roams the desolate remnants of Evershade, driven by a singular, unwavering purpose. Clad in tattered, once-ceremonial robes that flutter in the wind, the Pilgrim’s face is obscured by a weathered hood and a metal mask resembling a weeping visage. Their hands are gloved and clutch a staff topped with an intricately carved symbol of a fallen star, a relic of forgotten rituals.
  

**Background:**

The Last Pilgrim was once a devout guardian of the sacred rites that governed Evershade. When the village fell to ruin and the Shattered Legion’s invasion disrupted their duties, they became a solitary figure, desperately trying to uphold the lost traditions and protect what remains of the village’s sanctity. Now, they wander the ruins, seeking to restore the village’s honor or, failing that, to ensure its secrets remain undisturbed.

  

**Abilities:**

- **Blessing of the Forgotten:** The Pilgrim channels ancient rites to invoke protective wards that create barriers of spiritual energy, reducing incoming damage by 50% and making it difficult for enemies to approach.

- **Wail of Desolation:** The Pilgrim emits a mournful wail that echoes through the ruins, causing nearby enemies to suffer a -2 penalty to their attack rolls and forcing them to make a Willpower check or become disoriented for one turn.

- **Spectral Conjure:** With a sweep of their staff, the Pilgrim summons spectral apparitions that can harass and distract foes. These apparitions deal minor psychic damage and cause confusion, imposing a -1 penalty on rolls related to combat or decision-making.

- **Sacred Rebirth:** When reduced to half HP, the Pilgrim can perform a ritual that temporarily shields them from harm, regaining 10% of their total HP and gaining a +1 bonus to their defense rolls for the next turn.

  

**Weaknesses:**

- **Burdened by Duty:** The Pilgrim is driven by their sense of responsibility and can become fixated on protecting certain locations or artifacts, making them less responsive to threats outside their immediate focus.

- **Emotional Vulnerability:** The Pilgrim’s resolve is tied to the village’s fate, and they are deeply affected by any desecration or disruption of sacred sites. Actions that mock or threaten their mission can cause them to lose focus, imposing a -2 penalty to their abilities for a short period.

  

**Treasure and Rewards:**

- **Pilgrim’s Staff:** A magical staff that enhances the wielder's spiritual abilities, granting +2 to rolls related to protective spells and rituals.

- **Mask of the Weeping Visage:** A mask that, when worn, provides resistance to fear-based effects and grants the wearer the ability to sense nearby magical disturbances.

- **Last Pilgrim’s Cloak:** A tattered cloak that offers +1 to defense rolls and has a chance to temporarily conceal the wearer in shadows, making them harder to hit in combat.

**Lore:**

The Last Pilgrim is a tragic remnant of Evershade’s once-sacred order. Their presence is a poignant reminder of the village’s lost glory and the profound sense of duty that bound its people. As they wander the ruins, their quest remains—to either reclaim their lost heritage or to ensure that the village’s secrets are preserved, even if it means facing those who now intrude upon their sacred ground.
