_Tucked behind the village on higher ground, the Silent Graveyard is overgrown with ivy and soft moss, its headstones leaning at odd angles like sleepers trapped mid-prayer. Time and moisture have erased most names, but the sorrow here lingers. The air is unusually still—no birds, no insects, no breeze. Only the occasional creak of old trees or the sudden cry of a mourning spirit breaks the silence._


**Trap / Hazard / Encounter:**

- **The Cold Earth Beckons**: Certain graves, if disturbed or even walked across, exhale spectral energy that chills the bones. [[Risk Roll]] to avoid living the trauma of someone else’s death. Condition: Dead-Alive

- **Graves That Whisper**: Some stones hum faintly when approached. If touched, they experience a vivid death memory—either their own (future) or someone else’s (past).   
	- If resisted, gain condition (Unquiet dead).  
	- If accepted, they may **ask one question of the spirit** that lingers, but they must answer one in return. [[Risk Roll]] Give them a positive or negative condition
	- Optional mechanic: reward players for engaging with it.
    
- **[[Gravemind Rootsnare]]**: In one overgrown corner, tree roots coil around half-sunken graves. If blood or emotion is spilled nearby, they animate as a semi-sentient tangle that lashes out.  
	- Will not animate if player is wearing the **Charm of Absolution** or the **Silver Locket of Eternal Vows**.    

**Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing:**

- **The Summoning of the Last Pilgrim**:  
    One weather-worn grave bears a strange, **shimmering red sigil**—barely visible except in certain light. Touching the stone **with bare flesh** while carrying an item of grief (e.g., the _[[Mourner’s Veil]]_, _[[Grief-Worn Doll]]_, or _[[Faded Love Letter]]_) causes **[[The Last Pilgrim]]** to appear, slowly walking from behind a row of graves as if stepping from memory itself.
    
    - **Optional Twist**: If summoned with respect (e.g., through grief), the Pilgrim may not attack, instead issuing a warning or offering a test. If summoned through theft or violence, the Pilgrim arrives enraged.
        
- **Gravestone of Liorna**: Half-covered in ivy, the stone reads only: _“She waited at the lake, even as it forgot her name.”_ 
	- Those holding the [[Silver Locket of Eternal Vows]] may receive a whispered message from her spirit here. 
	- Kneeling before it while holding the _Silver Locket_ reveals a brief vision of her final moments—standing at the lakeside, eyes full of faith.
- **[[Tear-Stained Chalice]]**: Hidden beneath a child’s grave marker, wrapped in rotted cloth. When used at [[Weeping Well]], it **grants temporary immunity to curses** but causes sorrowful hallucinations for a day.    
- **Spirit Trail**: By lighting the **Censer of Lament** near the statue of the Hollowed Saint, a trail of glowing footprints appears briefly, showing a path to a hidden crypt entrance beneath the graveyard.    

### Hidden Crypt – Beneath the Silent Graveyard

Accessed via a moss-covered stair revealed by lighting the **Censer of Lament** or following a **trail of spectral footprints**, this hidden crypt lies beneath the graveyard like a wound in the earth. The descent is narrow and claustrophobic, stone giving way to dirt and rot. The air smells of damp bone and ancient incense.

Time does not flow properly here. Candle wax that has long since melted still drips. Chanting that should have ended centuries ago echoes faintly from below.

**Room 1: The Antechamber of Regret**
- Walls carved with names scratched over and rewritten.    
- A mural depicts a priest removing his own face and placing it upon a mourner.    
- **Hazard**: Spirits here speak aloud the PCs' failures or deepest regrets. If ignored, the whispers intensify. If acknowledged (roleplayed), they subside and a **silver charm** is found tucked into a crack:    
    - **Charm of Absolution** – Once per session, remove a single point of Ruin. Can only be used after expressing honest guilt.

**Room 2: The Chamber of the Hollowed Saint**
- A broken statue of a saint kneeling, face crumbled away.    
- Surrounding it are dozens of tiny **offering bowls**, now dry.    
- **Ritual**: Filling a bowl with **a tear**, **blood**, or **lakewater** causes a vision:    
    - The Saint opens its arms and whispers a name from the PC’s memory.        
    - Players can ask **one question** of the past, and the answer will come in metaphor.

**Room 3: The Reclamation Tomb**

- A sealed vault containing the broken weapons and vestments of failed pilgrims.    
- Centerpiece: a heavy stone sarcophagus bound in runes. Inside lies:
    
    #### **The Mirror of the Last Pilgrim**
    
    A polished obsidian mirror, cracked. Anyone who looks into it sees:    
    1. **The moment they would have stayed in Evershade.**        
    2. **A path not taken, guarded by someone they trust.**        
    3. **The Last Pilgrim kneeling, asking for permission to forget.**        
    
    **Effect:**    
    - Can be used as a **divination tool** or **portal anchor** once per session.        
    - Once used, it **takes a memory** from the user (lose a bond, backstory element, or motivation).        
    - Holding it in combat against the **Last Pilgrim** weakens him (-1 defense) but invokes sorrow in the wielder (gain 1 Ruin).
