_Once the center of the village, the Hollowed Tavern was a place of warmth, drink, and stories. Now, it stands as a rotting husk of itself—its wooden beams swollen with moisture, the hearth cold, and chairs collapsed in disuse. Yet the air here feels thicker, heavier, as if memory itself lingers like smoke. Sometimes, on the edge of hearing, the crack of a tankard or the lilt of a love song flickers through the silence._

**Trap / Hazard / Encounter:**  
Inside the tavern, the spirits of the dead villagers occasionally replay their final moments in spectral echoes—reliving laughter, arguments, confessions, even deaths. These **Residual Echoes** can cause disorientation or even possession if approached carelessly.

- **Spectral Loop**: A patron at the hearth relives his final toast every night. If you step into the circle, you feel a deep chill. Roll a [[Risk Roll]] to relive his final triumph or regret (reward, positive or negative condition).  

- **Glass Shard Trap**: Beneath the broken bar lies a shattered mirror. If uncovered, it reveals a twisted reflection of whoever looks into it—showing a version of you who in the final days of [[Evershade]]. [[Risk Roll]] to gain insight into the village’s collapse (reward, positive or negative condition)...  either way, your name is in the Registry.  

**Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing:**

- Move this to Cistern or Church **[[Censer of Lament]]**: Hanging in a charred alcove near the hearth, this rusted brass censer can still be lit. When filled with the right herbs, it **calms spirits** within the area but **induces sorrowful visions** in those who carry it. 

- **Bottle of Salted Flame**: Behind the bar lies a sealed bottle of spirit made from water from the [[Lake of Tears]] and rare herbs. When drunk, it grants the condition (magical) which restores 1 use of a magical item or allows one re-roll during a ritual, but causes momentary memory loss.

- **Old Registry Book**: A mold-ridden ledger listing the names of travelers who passed through before the fall. If your name is written in it (or appears mysteriously), the spirits recognize you as a friend—changing how encounters unfold within the tavern and graveyard. May also contain a clue about Alaric or Liora.
