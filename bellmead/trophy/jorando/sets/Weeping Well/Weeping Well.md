_There is a place beneath Evershade where grief has pooled for centuries—a place unspoken, yet known. The Weeping Well is older than the village above, its stones eroded smooth by tears and time. A vine-choked ladder leads down into shadow and stillness, past slick stone and votive carvings barely visible under moss. At the bottom: silence, broken only by the drip of water and the sigh of something remembering._

The faithful once came here to cast away sorrow, but the sorrow clung. It soaked into the stone and wept back. Now, forgotten relics rot beside fetid water, and something stirs within—a watcher of grief, the Seer of the Well. And deeper still lies a path nearly forgotten—one taken by only the most desperate or damned. The Hidden Tunnel connects this place to the Cistern beneath the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints.
### Goals:
* Navigate through the Weeping Well and discover the hidden tunnel to the Cistern—without becoming part of the shrine's mournful liturgy.
* Seek out the Seer and learn why she weeps.
### Moments:
- A soft, echoing sob that no one admits to making.
- Old votive candles that light themselves when someone weeps.
- Water that flows up the well walls before falling back down.
- A ghostly hand caresses someone’s cheek during descent.
* The Seer appears during a moment of confession.
* Water rises rapidly when a name from the past is spoken.
* Ancient runes flare as the hidden tunnel is discovered.
* Something speaks through the altar in the Forgotten Chamber.

### Questions:
- Who in the party has lost someone recently?
- What item did you bring to leave behind here?
- What inscription is still visible on the shrine?

### Locations / Traps / Opportunities:

#### [[The Well Shaft]]

#### **[[The Tunnel Entrance]]**
Hidden beneath the well, marked by ancient runes that glow faintly with cursed energy.
  - *Trap*: Opening the tunnel without understanding the runes triggers a psychic scream.

#### [[The Hidden Tunnel]]
A dark, damp passage connecting the Weeping Well to the cistern beneath the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints. The walls are slick with moisture, and the air is thick with the stench of decay and the echo of distant weeping. The path is narrow and treacherous, with many places where the walls seem to close in.
  - *Treasure*: The Mourner’s Signet (see Items)
#### [[The Murmuring Cell]]
A small, secret room branching off the tunnel. Used long ago by Hollowed Saints for forbidden rites. Its walls are lined with crumbling books, rusted ritual implements, and an altar that glows faintly with lingering corruption.

### Baddies:
[[Wailbound Drowned]]
### Boss: 
#### [[Seer of the Well]]

### Items:

1. **[[Mourner’s Signet]]**
2. **[[Tearcatch Flask]]**
3. **[[Rope of Names]]**
4. **[[Candle of Remorse]]**
5. **[[Moss-Runed Stone]]**

6. **Dust-Covered Manuscript**

   - *Mechanic*: Once per delve, roll to invoke one of the forbidden miracles. Gain +1 Ruin.
   - *Quote*: “Its words are wet with memory.”

   **Forbidden Miracles (d6):**

   1. **Ashen Benediction** – Choose a dead character. For one scene, you may act as though they are present—invoking one of their abilities or items. Then gain +1 Ruin.\
      *“Their ashes line the pages. Their words still whisper when the book is warm.”*

   2. **Threnody of Chains** – Bind a ghost or spirit in place for one turn. During this time, it may be questioned, but not harmed. Gain +1 Ruin if you ask it something personal.\
      *“We sang the dead into stillness. They do not sleep, but they listen.”*

   3. **The Unmaking of Names** – Erase a name from a physical surface. The target bound to it loses a sense of purpose or identity for one scene.\
      *“What is remembered binds. What is forgotten drifts.”*

   4. **Cleansing by Sorrow** – Burn the manuscript at a shrine. One character removes all Burdens but gains +2 Ruin and sees a vision of someone else's grief they can never forget.
      *“Sorrow is sacred when given freely. But sacred things burn.”*

   5. **Echo of the Hollowed** – Summon a Hollowed Saint as a spectral companion for one scene. It opens a path or offers guidance—but leaves behind a Wailbound echo.\
      *“We carved their faces into stone, but it was their cries we remembered.”*

   6. **Whisper of the Forgotten** – Gain insight into a long-lost secret or passage. But you lose the ability to speak until the end of the delve.\
      *“The forgotten speak in silence, and silence speaks in return.”*

   **How the Miracles are Discovered (d6):**

   1. **Whispered Revelation** – The pages are blank. The miracle is heard in the voice of a dead loved one, echoing from the dark.
   2. **Ink That Runs with Tears** – The writing only appears when someone weeps while holding the book.
   3. **Stitched Into the Pages** – Black thread forms symbols only legible to those who’ve known loss.
   4. **Read by Flame** – The text appears only by the light of the Candle of Remorse.
   5. **The Book Speaks** – The manuscript moans aloud its secrets when opened beside the Forgotten Shrine.
   6. **Ritual Reenactment** – A player accidentally reenacts part of the rite, triggering the memory and revealing the miracle.

### Moments of Light
### Way Forward

- **To The Cistern** via Hidden Tunnel.
- **Back to Evershade** via the well shaft.
- **Subversion**: use the [[Moss-Runed Stone]] to find a hidden passage in [[The Murmuring Cell]] That leads to the [[The Cistern]]
- 

### Crossing the Threshold

1. **The Gate of Names** – Whisper a name you've never spoken aloud. Learned via a moss-runed stone (“What you do not say binds you still”) or a scrawled page in the Dust-Covered Manuscript.

   > *“To pass, you must give what time would take. The forgotten are the price of passage.”*

2. **The Turning of the Wheel** – Two must rotate the rusted mechanism in harmony. Discovered via a hymnbook note or visualized using the Candle of Remorse.

   > *“Their hands built the wheel. Their regrets turn it still.”*

3. **The Mirror Pool** – Each adventurer must voice a regret. Hinted by a phrase on the Mourner’s Signet or a whisper from the Seer.

   > *“The mask bears no judgment. Only the reflection does.”*

4. **The Drowned Choir** – Harmonize vocally or ritually with submerged statues. Foreshadowed in a crumbling hymnbook or activated by the Blood-Slicked Censer.

   > *“When we sang, the sorrow parted. When we stopped, it returned.”*
