![[ww-i-rope-of-names.png|300]]

A length of fraying rope, its fibers dark with age and moisture. Dozens of knots are tied along its length, and from each hangs a small, rusted tag etched with a name—most now illegible. The rope hums faintly, as if remembering.

_“Each knot is a promise. Each name, a weight we carry.”_

**Effect:** May be used to safely escape one fall. Can also be used in rites requiring remembrance of the dead.
