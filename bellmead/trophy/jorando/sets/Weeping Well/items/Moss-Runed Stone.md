A smooth, flat stone the size of a palm, damp with age and heavy with memory. Ancient runes etched deep into its surface are filled with living moss that glows faintly in the dark. When held close, the runes feel warm—like breath held too long.

_“What you do not say binds you still.”_

**Effect:** Reveals hidden doors, passageways, or scripts when brought near them. However, carrying it for too long causes +1 Ruin as the stone absorbs unspoken thoughts and grief.

**Key:** This will help get to [[The Murmuring Cell]] as well as the subversion past the door of names. If used to subvert the door of names, mark 1 Ruin.
