A delicate glass vessel with a long, tapering neck and a cork stopper blackened by time. The inside shimmers faintly, as if catching light that isn’t there. Old symbols are etched faintly into the base—prayers for the grieving, now barely legible.

_“Grief sanctified is still grief.”_

**Effect:** Fills when grief is spoken nearby. Can be used as holy water against spirits or corrupted beings.
