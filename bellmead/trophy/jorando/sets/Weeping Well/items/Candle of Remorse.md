A slender taper of blackened wax, twisted as if melted in grief. When lit, its flame burns with a pale blue hue, casting long, flickering shadows that seem to whisper. The wick smells faintly of myrrh and sorrow.

_“It burns with what we do not say.”_

**Effect:** When lit, nearby illusions—spiritual or magical—become visible. Spirits cannot lie in its light. Must be used in silence.
