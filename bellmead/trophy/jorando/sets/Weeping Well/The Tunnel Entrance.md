At the bottom of the shaft, where the ladder ends in darkness and dripping silence, lies a narrow arch of stone, nearly swallowed by roots and runes. The **Tunnel Entrance** is slick with condensation, and the air grows suddenly dense—heavy with the taste of iron and mildew. The mouth of the tunnel is sealed by a circular slab etched with spiraling symbols. Some glow faintly when breath fogs the air. Others seem to shift when no one watches.

To open the path forward, grief must be named—or misunderstood pain must be paid.

### Paint the Scene

Ask the players:
- One of the runes pulses when you get close. What memory flashes behind your eyes?    
- What smell from your childhood is suddenly, violently present?    
- What part of your body begins to ache for no clear reason?

### Traps / Hazards

- **Runes of Confession**:  
    The seal can only be opened by correctly interpreting the runes—symbols of sorrow, loss, and memory. Attempting to pry or force the seal triggers a **psychic scream**:  
    _Effect_: Each party member must pass a **Willpower or Resolve check**, or suffer hallucinations of past failures and gain 1 Ruin or Burden.    
- **The Echo Wall**:  
    Any word spoken too loudly is repeated back—mockingly—by the stones, but _changed slightly_, revealing a darker truth.  
    _Effect_: Insightful players may use this as a clue, or fall prey to disorientation and delay.

### Treasures / Secrets

- **The Mourner’s Signet** fits perfectly into a circular recess near the slab. If used, the seal will open without harm—and one of the runes whispers a forgotten truth to the wearer.    
- **Candle of Remorse** (if lit) causes the wall to bleed faint glowing lines that trace a safe path forward—only visible to those who’ve spoken a regret at the well.    
- **Fragment of a Forgotten Psalm** is scrawled faintly in the dust. Reciting it with sincerity may open the seal or draw something _else_ near.

### Visual & Sensory Cues

- Mist clings low along the floor, rolling like breath from unseen mouths.    
- A sound like weeping echoes faintly from deeper within.    
- Carvings of faceless figures line the sides of the arch, some with hands outstretched as if offering—or warning.

### Transitions

- **Forward**: Into the **Hidden Tunnel**—a narrow, winding descent lined with sorrow-stained stone.    
- **Back**: Return up the **Well Shaft**—though now, the ladder feels longer.
