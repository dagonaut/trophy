_The descent into the Weeping Well begins at a vine-choked ring of stone, nearly swallowed by the ruins of Evershade. A rusted iron ladder vanishes into darkness. Each rung bears a name—some carved with reverence, others violently scratched out. The air grows colder with every step, thick with the scent of wet stone and faded incense. The only sound is water dripping… from somewhere far below, or perhaps from your own eyes._

**Atmosphere:**
- The walls sweat with moisture that smells faintly of salt and sorrow.    
- Glowing lichen reveals old votive markings: saints with erased faces, names no longer remembered.    
- A sob echoes faintly—and no one will admit to making it.
### Paint the Scene
- What name do you find carved on the rung just below your hand—and why does it hurt to see it?    
- What object on your person suddenly feels _heavier_ as you descend, as though burdened by memory?    
- What sound from below reminds you of someone you lost?

### Traps / Hazards
- **Grief-Strained Rung**: If any character spoke aloud about a past grief in the village above, one rung will crumble beneath their weight. The fall isn’t deadly, but it jostles everyone and may alert something waiting below.  
    _Effect_: Risk roll to avoid slipping, or take a Burden (psychic shock, twisted ankle, etc.)    
- **The Watching Name**: One rung is freshly carved with a party member’s name—one they haven’t told the others.  
    _Effect_: Sanity check or Ruin gain if confronted.

###  Secrets & Interactions
- **Touching a Carving**: If a character traces one of the names with their finger and speaks a memory aloud, they are briefly surrounded by warmth and whispering light. Gain a white die on the next Willpower roll.    
- **Votive Symbol**: One of the symbols glows when someone cries—this may be used to reveal a hidden message or clue about the **Gate of Names** later.
### Treasures / Clues
- **Rope of Names** (on a hook halfway down):  
    _A knotted rope once used in sacred rites. Each knot is etched with a name._  
    _Mechanic_: Escape one fall. When used, hear a whisper of who tied each knot.    
- **Tearcatch Flask** (tucked into a crevice):  
    _Fills when grief is nearby. Can be used as holy water._  
    _Quote_: “Grief sanctified is still grief.”    
- **Inscription Shard**:  
    _Broken piece of stone with half a confession etched into it. The rest may be found in the **Mirror Pool** or the **Cistern**._  
    _Mechanic_: Acts as a key for the Gate of Names, but costs 1 Ruin when invoked.    

### Transitions
- **Downward**: Continue into the **Tunnel Entrance**—a narrow opening veiled with moss, guarded by ancient runes.    
- **Upward**: Return to **Evershade**, but something may now follow.
