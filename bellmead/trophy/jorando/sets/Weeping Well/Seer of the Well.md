**Des. ription**: The Seer was once a prophetess who could see the future, but the power of the well twisted her visions into nightmares. Now, she is a spectral figure who haunts the well, her eyes hollow and her mouth sewn shut to prevent her from speaking the horrors she has seen. Her presence causes the waters of the well to ripple with dark energy, and her very touch can show a person their darkest future.

**Weaknesses**:
* Cannot see you if you show no sorrow.
- **Echoes of the Past** – The Seer can be weakened by playing an ancient melody that was once sung in the village. Players must find a way to reproduce this melody to disrupt her powers. [[Broken Music Box]]

**Abilities**:
- Causes visions of past grief. Absorbs spoken confessions to empower itself.
 - **Curse of Silence** – The Seer can curse a player, rendering them unable to speak or cast spells. This curse can only be lifted by defeating her or using a rare item found in the well (Mourner's Signet).
