**Description**: The Seer was once a prophetess who could see the future, but the power of the well twisted her visions into nightmares. Now, she is a spectral figure who haunts the well, her eyes hollow and her mouth sewn shut to prevent her from speaking the horrors she has seen. Her presence causes the waters of the well to ripple with dark energy, and her very touch can show a person their darkest future.

**Weaknesses**:
* Cannot see you if you show no sorrow.  
- **Echoes of the Past** – The Seer can be weakened by playing an ancient melody that was once sung in the village. Players must find a way to reproduce this melody to disrupt her powers. [[Broken Music Box]]

**Abilities**:
- Causes visions of past grief. Absorbs spoken confessions to empower itself.
 - **Curse of Silence** – The Seer can curse a player, rendering them unable to speak or cast spells. This curse can only be lifted by defeating her or using a rare item found in the well (Mourner's Signet).

**Treasure**:

 - Veil of the Seer (Helm) – A ghostly veil that grants the wearer visions of the future but at the cost of their sanity. It also provides resistance to mind-affecting spells.
 - Ring of Echoes (Accessory) – A silver ring that allows the wearer to communicate telepathically with others but slowly causes them to hear the thoughts of everyone around them, leading to potential madness.

#### Lore & Background

Before she became the silent prophet of the **Weeping Well**, the Seer was known as **Sister Aelitha**, a gentle oracle from the Church of the Hollowed Saints. Aelitha was gifted with true foresight—able to glimpse moments yet to come—but she bore the burden of prophecy with increasing sorrow. Her visions were not of triumphs or blessings, but of inevitable suffering: the fall of Evershade, the hollowing of saints, the drowning of sacred places.

The priests commanded her to record what she saw and remain silent otherwise. When she began warning the people of the village, they silenced her permanently. Her mouth was sewn shut in a rite of “mercy,” and she was lowered into the Weeping Well with the belief that her grief could be transferred to the waters.

Instead, her grief grew so deep it merged with the well itself.  
### Connection to the music box

The **Broken Music Box** once belonged to a child Aelitha comforted—a little girl brought to the lake after the death of her parents. Aelitha would hum a simple lullaby while the child wept. The child gave her the box as a gift, saying, _"So you won’t be alone when you cry."_

When Aelitha was imprisoned in the well, she would hum the tune in the darkness until her voice gave out. Even now, the faint melody carried by the music box stills her rage for a moment and reminds her of something she no longer fully understands: kindness.

Aelitha hummed with
