_Tucked behind a false wall in the Hidden Tunnel, the **Murmuring Cell** is a cramped, circular chamber carved from black-veined stone. Stale air presses on your chest like a hand. Along the curved walls are crumbling book alcoves, rusted chains, and half-melted wax figures frozen mid-supplication. An altar of bone-white marble pulses faintly—its surface cracked, but still warm. Faint breaths echo here, though no one speaks. Some say the Hollowed Saints were **undone** here—whispered empty by rites they could no longer bear._

Once a sacred chamber for troubled priests of the Hollowed Church, the Murmuring Cell is a small, windowless room beneath the altar at the Ruined Church. Its walls are carved with a thousand tiny confessions, some scratched in with bloodied nails, others carefully etched as prayers. At its center is a small iron stand, black with soot, made to hold a single candle.

Here, the broken and burdened came to speak aloud the horrors they had witnessed—visions, sins, doubts—and by doing so, cleanse themselves. Or so the Church claimed. The truth is more complex: some left the chamber renewed, others hollowed, their burdens lifted but their minds frayed. It was not only a place of confession, but of punishment disguised as penance.

The Candle of Remorse was always lit here. It still waits on its stand.

_"Speak, and you may walk free. But some things, once spoken, do not leave you."_

This is a place where Priests that were having trouble went to speak the horrors they learned and renew their vows and devotion to the Hollowed Church. You spoke it to remove it from yourself. It seems penitent, but perhaps its punitive. 

### Paint the Scene

Ask the players:
- What object in this room reminds you of something buried—emotionally or literally?    
- What faint phrase do you think you hear repeated again and again?    
- What item in this room do you know, without doubt, should _not_ be touched?
- Imagine you could carve stone with your own breath... how long would that take?

### Traps / Effects

- **Lingering Breath**: Anyone who lingers here too long begins to exhale frost, even in the warm air. This breath carries their secrets into the room, where they might manifest.  
    _Effect_: Gain +1 Ruin if you speak aloud here. Those who whisper may attract something waiting.
    
- **Grief Mirror**: A dusty shard of obsidian set into the altar reveals not your reflection, but the moment you last wept.  
    _Effect_: Staring too long forces a Willpower check or risk hallucinating a conversation with the person you mourned.
    
- **The Hung Chain**: One rusted chain dangles from the ceiling, swaying though no wind blows. If grasped, it burns the palm—and shows a brief, psychic flash of a forgotten Hollowed rite.  
    _Effect_: Lose 1 HP, but gain insight into a hidden passage or puzzle (e.g. Gate of Names or Cistern mechanism).

### Secrets & Interactions
- **Dust-Covered Manuscript** sits beneath the altar in a bowl of salt and ash.  
    _Mechanic_: Once per delve, roll to invoke a **Forbidden Miracle** (see Seer of the Well). Gain 1 Ruin.  
    _Interaction Table_: May reveal itself by light of the **Candle of Remorse**, or whisper a miracle when the **Tearcatch Flask** is spilled nearby.    
- **Blood-Slicked Censer** hangs in the alcove.  
    _Mechanic_: Swinging it summons Wailbound echoes. Used ritually, it allows communion with a Saint’s last breath.    
- **Chalk Sigil on the Floor**: Half-faded, but restorable with tears or water from the well. Can create a protective ward or teleportation glyph—_but something will be left behind_.

### Transition Points
- **Secret Passage (1-in-6)** to the **Cistern**, bypassing part of the Gate of Names puzzle.    
- **Return** to the **Hidden Tunnel**—but the exit now feels... narrower.

### Possible Items Hidden Here
- **Veinroot Candle**: Burns blue and hums when a lie is spoken nearby.    
- **Fragment of a Hollowed Jawbone**: May be used once to issue a command to any spirit.    
- **Hair-Tied Scroll**: A lost vow, written in blood and bound in a saint’s braid. Reading it aloud grants clarity—or madness.
