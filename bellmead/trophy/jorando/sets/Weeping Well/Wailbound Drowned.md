**Spectral Drowned Horror (Threat Level: Moderate–High)**

**Appearance:**  
A semi-corporeal figure half-formed from waterlogged rags, rotted flesh, and swirling black water. Its limbs twist and surge with unnatural flow, and its face is a drowned echo—blurred, weeping, and shifting between the forms of those its victims once loved.

**Abilities:**

- **Grief Current:** The Drowner drags a target toward it with a tendril of water. On a failed check, the target is pulled into melee range and suffers a -1 to their next action due to breathlessness and panic.    
- **Echo Drown:** Once per encounter, the Drowner mimics the voice of a loved one lost, forcing nearby players to pass a **Willpower check** or be stunned for one turn as their grief resurfaces.    
- **Floodform:** When bloodied, the Drowner collapses into a wave and reforms elsewhere in the room, gaining a +1 to evade rolls until struck again.    

**Weakness:**  
Cannot enter sanctified ground or cross running water. If confronted with its true name (sometimes whispered by spirits near the **Moss-Runed Stone**), it becomes vulnerable for one turn.

**Behavior (d6):**
1. Clings to walls, whispering regrets in voices not its own.    
2. Drowns votive offerings left at the base of the well.    
3. Stalks silently just beyond the edge of torchlight.    
4. Leaves puddles shaped like weeping figures.    
5. Mimics sobbing until someone comes close.    
6. Freezes briefly when someone speaks their own grief aloud.
