**Twisted Branch**  
_A gnarled length of wood grown in the Ruined Church’s shadow. Iron-hard thorns jut where buds should be; scraps of mourning ribbon cling to its knots. When pressed to the ear, it creaks like pews in an empty nave._

_“Watered in tears, it learned to drink instead of bloom.”_

**Effect:** Weakens the Hollowed Saints who guard the Reliquary (–4).
Also just a weapon (if the players don't grok it's full use)
