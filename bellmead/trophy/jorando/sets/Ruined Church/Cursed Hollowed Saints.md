(Endurance 8)

Once devoted priests, the saints hollowed themselves to bear the sorrows of others. Now, they are husks of faith, twisted by the curse, bound in rusted vestments and ancient grief .

#### Abilities
- **Bound Devotion**: Immune to all harm unless a sacred relic ([[Sacrificial Dagger]]) is used to break their defense .    
- **Unending Vigil**: Upon defeat, a saint’s hymn will resurrect them once—players must perform the Choir’s Hymn to silence their song permanently .    
- **Spirit Transference**: Emulating the Cathedral Deacons, a central wailing spirit can abandon any fallen body and possess another, forcing players to track and destroy the true spirit form.    

#### Weaknesses
- A proper rendition of the Choir’s Hymn, found in the Forgotten Scriptures, prevents the **Unending Vigil** .    
- Strikes delivered with the Sacrificial Dagger during their ritual sequences bypass **Bound Devotion**, inflicting full damage .    

#### Treasures

1. **Reliquary of the Hollowed Saints** (Artifact) – Grants a miracle once per delve but curses the bearer with a lingering sorrow .    
2. **Saint’s Fingerbone** (Trinket) – Bestows divine protection for one scene, granting advantage on saves against fear and charm .    
3. **Censer of Mournful Incense** (Accessory) – When burned, slows enemies in a 10-foot radius and wards curses; three uses per delve .
