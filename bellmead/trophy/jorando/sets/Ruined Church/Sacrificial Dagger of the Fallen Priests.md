**Description** A rusted sacrificial dagger, its blade dull and pitted, etched with nearly worn holy runes. Corroded stains cling to the hilt, as if the blade has drunk the tears and blood of countless mourners.

**Lore Quote** _“Forged in sorrow, its edge hungers for the grief of the devout.”_

**Mechanic** When equipped, strikes inflict the _Weeping_ status, dealing 3% of the target’s maximum health as holy damage over 6 seconds. Additionally, each successful _Weeping_ proc restores 5 stamina to the wielder.
