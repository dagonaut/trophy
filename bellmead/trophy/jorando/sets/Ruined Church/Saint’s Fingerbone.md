_A desiccated phalanx bound in prayer-ribbon and sealed with wax. The bone is polished smooth by centuries of handling and hums faintly, warm to the touch, as if remembering every sorrow pressed into it._

_“The Saints took our burdens, and in taking, hollowed themselves. What remains still drinks.”_
_"The question remains, where is the rest of the hand?"_

**Effect**: Can be used to remove 1 Ruin
