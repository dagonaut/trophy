Endurance 8

A tithe chest taught to hunger. The lid is a jaw of ironwood teeth; hinges flex like knuckles; a braided lock becomes a barbed tongue. It breathes incense and mildew and shuffles on stilted legs when unobserved. It prefers the shadows near altars and confessionals, where thieves and pilgrims both put their hands where it can bite.

As [[Lake of Tears]] and the saints became corrupted, the environment around it became corrupted as well. Sometimes objects drew some of the worst characteristics of people. 

**Weakness (–4):** A **tear** dripped into its keyhole. For the rest of the scene it slackens and may be safely opened or driven off.

**Abilities**

- **Feign Treasure:** Counts as a **Trap** until revealed; first touch triggers a sudden bite and grapple.  
- **Latch & Gnash:** Clamps shut, pinning arms, crushing gear, and dragging prey inside.     
- **Tongue of Chain:** Snatches loose objects (keys, rings, relics) from up to a few paces away.  
- **Coffer Scuttle:** Scrambles to a new hiding place the moment watchers look away or lights dim.  


**Treasure**

- Swallowed tithes: coins, rings, minor relics (1–3 Finds).      
- 1-in-6: a **Key** relevant to the Ruined Church (door, cage, reliquary).      
- 1-in-6: a saint’s token (counts as a **Ward** against church spirits for one delve).      

**d6: What betrays this coffer**
1. The chain curls the wrong way, like a question mark.      
2. A damp clicking “breath” from inside the box.      
3. Fresh scratches around the lock—teeth marks, not tools.      
4. A smear of wax-tear on the lid, still wet.      
5. The lid twitches when hymns are sung.      
6. Dusty coin trail leading precisely to the chest, then stopping.
