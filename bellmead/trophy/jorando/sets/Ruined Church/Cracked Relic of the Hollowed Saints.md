_A palm-sized icon of gilded faces, split by a spiderweb crack. When dampened with tears, a thin seam of light seeps through and the saints’ features seem to strain—smiling, or screaming._

_“They took our grief until the casing failed; what leaks out still remembers.”_

**Effect:** Counts as a **Key** to the Reliquary of the Hollowed Saints.
