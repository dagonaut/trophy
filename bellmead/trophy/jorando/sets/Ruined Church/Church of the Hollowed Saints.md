The church stands alone on a shrinking island, barely large enough to support its crumbling foundations. Once a grand structure surrounded by gardens and shrines, it now teeters on the brink of collapse, the lake having slowly claimed the land over centuries. No one remembers when the waters began to rise, only that they did so after the saints ceased their vigil. [[Lake of Tears]], once sacred, has become tainted, its surface reflecting not light but loss.

Inside, decay reigns. The Hollowed Saints who once absolved grief now guard their reliquary with cursed fervor. Their faith twisted by despair, they remain bound to the church and its crypt. The Weeping Well beneath, fed by underground springs and sorrow, connects to the Cistern, and carries with it whispers of the church's final days.

### Goals
