A rusted Halberd frequently carried by members of  [[The Shattered Legion]]. Its hilt is still in tact, but its blade is chipped and rusted. It will still serve you in a fight, but not for long. 

_”If the The Shattered Legion are convinced [[Kalduhr]] is their rightful home, why are they intent on burning it to the ground?”_

Mechanic: A weapon. A poor one at that.
