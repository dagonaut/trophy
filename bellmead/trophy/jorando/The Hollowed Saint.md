The Original Hollowed Saint had never known sorrow. He grew up sheltered from all the pains of the world. Until one day he snuck out and discovered the pain of the world. From that point forward, he sought to not fix it, just find ways to help alleviate people from their pain. His story was the same as the priests. Since he had suffered no pain, he had room to take on the burdens of others.
