#### Buddha Version
The Original Hollowed Saint had never known sorrow. He grew up sheltered from all the pains of the world. Until one day he snuck out and discovered the pain of the world. From that point forward, he sought to not fix it, just find ways to help alleviate people from their pain. His story was the same as the priests. Since he had suffered no pain, he had room to take on the burdens of others. 

#### Sinister Version
The story told in the churches is that [[Father Lorian]], the First Hollowed Saint, bore the grief of the people out of compassion, until he wasted away and became a vessel of sorrow. The truth, however, is more dire.

In the days before the church rose, the [[Lake of Tears]] already whispered. Its waters mirrored not the sky, but memory itself—collecting sorrow as a moth to flame. Few dared drink from it, but one did: a nameless figure remembered only as the _Messenger_. This Messenger spoke with voices that were not their own, voices that seeped from the Lake, promising a world where sorrow could be harvested like grain.

It was the Messenger who found Lorian, a simple priest who believed too strongly in mercy. With gentle words, they guided him: _“Say to the people, ‘Let me bear your grief.’ Say it, and mean it.”_ Lorian did. And the Lake answered.

Every burden he took bled into him, hollowing him further. The Messenger stood by, tending him, whispering prayers that were not his own. As more pilgrims came, the Messenger encouraged them to weave tapestries, carve hymns, and record rites—not of Lorian’s kindness, but of ritual austerity, penance, and sacrifice. What had been one man’s doomed kindness was transformed into a codified practice of draining sorrow, not to heal the people, but to **feed the Lake**.

When Lorian died, the Messenger ensured his story was rewritten. His smile at the end was said to be holy benediction, but in truth he wept, realizing too late that he had been hollowed not to save others, but to tether them to the Lake forever. His body was buried in sanctified soil, but his sorrow was poured into the [[Reliquary of the Hollowed Saints]], a vessel crafted not to preserve his mercy, but to keep the Lake’s hunger near at hand.

Thus, the Order of the Hollowed Saints was born—not from benevolence gone astray, but from a plan as old as Jorando itself. And every prayer, every hymn, every burden cast into the Lake is not a release, but a tribute. The corruption of the land, the ruin of Jorando—it was always part of the design.

_"The Saint was kind, yes. But kindness is the finest knife, and he did not see whose hand pressed it to our throat."_ – Fragment of the Messenger’s Letters
