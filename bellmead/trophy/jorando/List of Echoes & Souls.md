### Alaric (The Last Pilgrim)
**Echo of the Pilgrim’s Vow**

_A tattered scrap of ribbon, faded blue, bound around a fragment of worn wood from his scythe. The fabric feels warm to the touch, as though still carrying the weight of a promise once made._

_"For her, I walked until my feet bled. For her, I carried every sorrow. For her, I will not falter, even now."_
_"For her, I went to war. For her, I killed an army. For her, I will continue to fight. For her, I will not falter, especially now."_

**Effect:**

- **Rite of Reclamation:** Burn the vow to shield another — transfer one Burden from an ally to yourself.      
- **Invocation:** Once per delve, the Echo steadies the weak — an ally automatically succeeds on a Willpower check.      
- **Transmutation:**      
    - **Pilgrim’s Scythe** — Restores stamina when used to strike spectral foes.          
    - **Ribbon of Liorna** — When worn, spirits and grave-markers react, whispering or glowing faintly to warn of danger.          


### Liorna
If Alaric’s Echo is **Devotion**, then Liorna’s is **Longing** — an endless waiting that hollowed her out. She embodies a tragic stillness: the one who stayed, who waited, and who was consumed by her own hope turned to sorrow. 

She cried into the Lake day after day waiting for him to return. Some say that her grief was so strong it was enough to corrupt the lake. 

**Echo of the Pilgrim’s Longing**

_A silver locket tarnished with age, inside a faded portrait of a woman gazing toward an unseen horizon. When opened, the air grows heavy, and for a moment it feels as though someone is waiting for you, just beyond reach._

_"I watched the waves and counted the hours. I waited until the waiting was all that I was."_

**Effect:**

- **Rite of Reclamation:** Consume the locket to bind your spirit to another — for one delve, you may transfer Ruin or Burden between you and an ally.
    
- **Invocation:** Once per delve, call upon her longing — an enemy is compelled to hesitate, distracted by memories of what they lost.
    
- **Transmutation:**
    
    - **Locket of Eternal Vows** — Grants resistance to despair and reveals whispers of the past when near graves or ruins.
        
    - **Chalice of Waiting** — When filled, its water reveals visions of someone absent or lost, but induces crushing melancholy.
        

Her tragedy complements Alaric:  
- He bore **duty** and walked on.      
- She bore **waiting** and wasted away.      

Together, their Echoes form a kind of dialogue: one of action and one of stillness — devotion vs. longing.

### Father Lorian

**Echo of Hollowed Duty**

![[echo-of-hollowed-duty.png|300]]

_A tarnished fingerbone wrapped in a strip of faded cloth, once part of Father Lorian’s habit. It is warm to the touch, carrying a faint, rhythmic thrum. To hold it is to feel the weight of all the grief Father Lorian took upon himself--not because he must, but because no one else would--countless sorrows layered atop one another until they blur together. What began as compassion grew into a rite, and what began as sacrifice became the foundation of a faith._

_"To bear their grief was my joy… and my undoing."_
### Aelitha  ([[Seer of the Well]])
**Echo of the Forsaken Sight**

![[echo-of-the-forsaken-sight.png|300]]

_A cracked shard of mirror glass, its surface veined with salt like dried tears. When held, the reflection shows not the present self, but a distorted glimpse of what may yet come—futures fractured, futures denied. Aelitha was cursed with knowledge, but damned by disbelief. Her warnings went unheard, and when her visions proved too dangerous, she was locked away. Isolation did not end the prophecies; they only deepened, met always with silence. In time, this futility curdled into scorn, and her resentment crystalized._

_"You will not heed me now. But when the water closes over you, remember my words."_

_"They called me mad. They sealed me away. I see them still, drowning in the end I foretold."_

**Effect:**
- **Rite of Reclamation:** Break the shard to rid yourself of one Burden — but gain another, as the shard binds you to a different grim fate.      
- **Invocation:** Once per delve, glimpse a bitter future — re-roll one failed test, but accept +1 Ruin as despair takes hold.      
- **Transmutation:**      
    - **Veil of the Seer** — A ghostly veil that grants visions of the future but at the cost of sanity.  
    - **Ring of Echoes** — Allows telepathic communion, but the voices grow unbearable over time.  

### The Drowned King

**Echo of the King’s Guilt**

_A fragment of his broken crown, heavy with salt and sorrow. The metal is warped, but when held it feels unbearably weighty—as though pressing down with the grief of a thousand drowned voices._

_"I was their king… and I led them to the water. I hear them still, calling my name, asking why I did nothing."_

**Effect:**

- **Rite of Reclamation:** Consume it to remove 1 Burden of guilt or grief from a character, but gain +1 Ruin as the King’s shame seeps into you.      
- **Invocation:** Once per delve, channel his remorse—foes within sight falter as despair grips them (-1 to all rolls for one scene).      
- **Transmutation:** Can be reforged into either:      
    - **Crown of Remorse**: Grants resistance to psychic effects, but wearer suffers nightmares and slow vitality loss.          
    - **Blade of Contrition**: A rusted sword that deals grievous wounds to foes, but each strike inflicts a wound of guilt on the wielder (cannot rest easily, risk of Ruin).
