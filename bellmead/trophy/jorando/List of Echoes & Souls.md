### Alaric (The Last Pilgrim)
**Echo of the Pilgrim’s Vow**
![[echo-of-the-pilgrims-vow.png|300]]
A tattered blue ribbon, frayed and stained with earth, once bound around Alaric’s wrist. Though faded, it still carries a faint shimmer, as if lit by the memory of devotion, and when touched, it quickens with another’s heartbeat. Alaric swore himself to Liorna with this ribbon as their bond, and when duty pulled him away to rebellion and loss, he carried it as his anchor, a vow he could not break. He walked until his feet bled, bore every burden placed upon him, and returned only to find her gone. Still he did not falter—he bound his life to her memory, to her protection even in death, carrying her presence like a lantern against the dark. His vow was his strength, his burden, and ultimately his cage.

_"Alaric returned to find his lover gone, he wept in Lacrimara, the last pilgrim to do so, and then began his vigil."_

_"For her, I walked until my feet bled. For her, I carried every sorrow. For her, I will not falter, even now."_
_"For her, I went to war. For her, I killed an army. For her, I will continue to fight. For her, I will not falter, especially now."_

**Effect:**
- **Rite of Reclamation:** Burn the vow to shield another — transfer one Burden from an ally to yourself.      
- **Invocation:** Once per delve, the Echo steadies the weak — an ally automatically succeeds on a Willpower check.      
- **Transmutation:**      
    - **Pilgrim’s Scythe** — Restores stamina when used to strike spectral foes.          
    - **Ribbon of Liorna** — When worn, spirits and grave-markers react, whispering or glowing faintly to warn of danger.          


### Liorna
##### **Echo of the Silent Vigil**
![[i-echo-silent-vigil.png|300]]
A tatter blue ribbon, soft and fine with strands of golden hair woven through its frayed ends. Liorna tied it in her hair the day Alaric left a token to match his own. As she stood vigil each night she grew frail until she was little more than a shadow. In death the ribbon fell from her hair and floated on the wind searching for its twin. The ribbon remembers her longing turned to silence.

_"I lit the lamp each night, though no footsteps came to the door. Still, I waited."_

##### **Echo of the Hollow Flame**
![[echo-of-the-hollow-flame.png|300]]
A small glass lantern, its frame blackened with soot, holds no flame — only a faint glow that stirs when grief is near. Each night Liorna carried it to the Bell Tower as a beacon for the one she loved, but no figure ever came. The flame guttered the night she died — her devotion burned to silence. Now, when held, the lantern flickers back to life, not with fire, but with the dim embers of a love unfulfilled.

_"I lit the lamp each night, though no footsteps came to the door. Still, I waited."_

Alt Text:
_A small, glass lantern, its frame blackened with soot. Inside is no flame, only a faint glow that stirs when grief is near. It feels warm in the hand, but its light never reaches far, as though it were meant only for someone who never arrived._

Each night, Liorna carried this lantern to the Bell Tower, lighting it as a beacon for the one she loved. Its smoke stained the stone, its glow became a fixture in the village, and still the figure she longed for never came. The flame guttered the night she died, but the lantern itself remains — not empty, but aching. It remembers her vigil, the long hours of waiting, the devotion that became longing, and the longing that burned itself away. Now, when held, the lantern flickers back to life, not with fire, but with the dim embers of a love unfulfilled.

##### More notes
If Alaric’s Echo is **Devotion**, then Liorna’s is **Longing** — an endless waiting that hollowed her out. She embodies a tragic stillness: the one who stayed, who waited, and who was consumed by her own hope turned to sorrow. 

She cried into the Lake day after day waiting for him to return. Some say that her grief was so strong it was enough to corrupt the lake. 

##### **Echo of the Pilgrim’s Longing**

_A silver locket tarnished with age, inside a faded portrait of a woman gazing toward an unseen horizon. When opened, the air grows heavy, and for a moment it feels as though someone is waiting for you, just beyond reach._

_"I watched the waves and counted the hours. I waited until the waiting was all that I was."_

**Effect:**

- **Rite of Reclamation:** Consume the locket to bind your spirit to another — for one delve, you may transfer Ruin or Burden between you and an ally.
    
- **Invocation:** Once per delve, call upon her longing — an enemy is compelled to hesitate, distracted by memories of what they lost.
    
- **Transmutation:**
    
    - **Locket of Eternal Vows** — Grants resistance to despair and reveals whispers of the past when near graves or ruins.
        
    - **Chalice of Waiting** — When filled, its water reveals visions of someone absent or lost, but induces crushing melancholy.
        

Her tragedy complements Alaric:  
- He bore **duty** and walked on.      
- She bore **waiting** and wasted away.      

Together, their Echoes form a kind of dialogue: one of action and one of stillness — devotion vs. longing.

### Father Lorian

**Echo of Hollowed Duty**

![[echo-of-hollowed-duty.png|300]]

_A tarnished fingerbone wrapped in a strip of faded cloth, once part of Father Lorian’s habit. It is warm to the touch, carrying a faint, rhythmic thrum. To hold it is to feel the weight of all the grief Father Lorian took upon himself--not because he must, but because no one else would--countless sorrows layered atop one another until they blur together. What began as compassion grew into a rite, and what began as sacrifice became the foundation of a faith._

_"To bear their grief was my joy… and my undoing."_
### Aelitha  ([[Seer of the Well]])
**Echo of the Forsaken Sight**

![[echo-of-the-forsaken-sight.png|300]]

_A cracked shard of mirror glass, its surface veined with salt like dried tears. When held, the reflection shows not the present self, but a distorted glimpse of what may yet come—futures fractured, futures denied. Aelitha was cursed with knowledge, but damned by disbelief. Her warnings went unheard, and when her visions proved too dangerous, she was locked away. Isolation did not end the prophecies; they only deepened, met always with silence. In time, this futility curdled into scorn, and her resentment crystalized._

_"You will not heed me now. But when the water closes over you, remember my words."_

_"They called me mad. They sealed me away. I see them still, drowning in the end I foretold."_

**Effect:**
- **Rite of Reclamation:** Break the shard to rid yourself of one Burden — but gain another, as the shard binds you to a different grim fate.      
- **Invocation:** Once per delve, glimpse a bitter future — re-roll one failed test, but accept +1 Ruin as despair takes hold.      
- **Transmutation:**      
    - **Veil of the Seer** — A ghostly veil that grants visions of the future but at the cost of sanity.  
    - **Ring of Echoes** — Allows telepathic communion, but the voices grow unbearable over time.  

### The Drowned King [[The Drowned King]]

**Echo of a King’s Guilt**
![[echo-of-a-kings-guilt.png|300]]
A broken shard of the crown of The Drowned who King failed to protect his people when the floods came—whether through command or inaction, none can say. Their cries clung tighter than any crown, sinking him to a throne of silt and bone. Accusation given form, and his silence echoing still.

_"I hear them still, asking why I didn't protect them."_


**Effect:**

- **Rite of Reclamation:** Consume it to remove 1 Burden of guilt or grief from a character, but gain +1 Ruin as the King’s shame seeps into you.      
- **Invocation:** Once per delve, channel his remorse—foes within sight falter as despair grips them (-1 to all rolls for one scene).      
- **Transmutation:** Can be reforged into either:      
    - **Crown of Remorse**: Grants resistance to psychic effects, but wearer suffers nightmares and slow vitality loss.          
    - **Blade of Contrition**: A rusted sword that deals grievous wounds to foes, but each strike inflicts a wound of guilt on the wielder (cannot rest easily, risk of Ruin).
