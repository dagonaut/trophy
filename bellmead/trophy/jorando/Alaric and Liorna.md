Lovers. Resistance to [[The Shattered Legion]]. Know shit was going wrong with the Lake. He was taken, she waited. She dies. Heâ€™s actually [[The Last Pilgrim]]?


[[The Bell Tower]]

[[Silver Locket of Eternal Vows]]


Alaric was a farmer that stood up and joined the resistance against [[The Shattered Legion]]. He was known from brandishing his [[Rusty Scythe]] like some kind of grim reaper harvesting the souls of the invading force.

After everything fell apart, he eventually escaped and returned Jorando, finding that sorrow had taken over and Liorna was dead. He wept his sorrows into the Lake of Tears, the Last Pilgrim to Lacrimara. He now acts as a sentry watching over the Bell Tower and grave of Liorna, warning against glory and that loyalty and devotion should be chosen carefully. If he is treated with respect, he shows you the way to the Bell Tower, if not, he red invades, but after his defeat, he may realize you're a good person and show you. If you show him any of Liorna's stuff, respectfully, he'll relent. 

Liorna knew about the Lake and was working to restore it. She used her legacy with Father Lorian and her secret area in the Bell Tower as a workshop. She spent a lot of time going over old tomes to find out what went wrong. She's the one that discovered the Rite of Reclamation. 

Liorna is a descendant of [[Father Lorian]]. She knows that things are whack and has been working on a solution. Thus the mural and [[The Bell Tower]] explanation.
