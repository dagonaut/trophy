* More rings with cool effects
* More weapons and armor. Somewhat mundane. Small effects. 
* Ask them about Gods
* helmet that is the face of a child
* Introduce a Hollowing Mechanic (like in [[The Cistern]]) across the whole Incursion
* chapel perilous (perhaps as part of the crypt/tomb in [[Evershade]])
* maybe introduce a new lantern in Evershade or leverage the use of the Jawbone lantern (they don’t lose it during the battle)… have a new thing, in case they lose it. Candle, Lantern, Fireflies, Will-o-Wisp follows you while wearing a certain amulet, oooo or ribbon in your hair.
* Yeah, we need a ribbon item (not too Bloodborne).
* Add better LORE to items.

Research in MD/Obsidian TAGS to help implement LORE links (maybe TOP MATTER), also for TODOs

A lot of the sorrow theme is “echos of someone you lost, voice of someone you lost…” What are some other ways to discuss/show/inflict sorrow outside of losing someone? Failure. Existential dread. Religious. Physical. Non-descript psychic pain.
