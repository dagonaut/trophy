**Lore and Significance:**

The **Lake of Tears** earned its name from the countless souls who have wept upon its shores. Long ago, this body of water was known as **Lacrimara**, the **Lake of Lament**, a place where the mourners of the ancient world would come to grieve their dead. It was believed that the waters of the lake held the sorrow of the world, drawing in the tears of those who suffered, and in return, offering them solace.

The lake's water is said to have a strange, ethereal quality, reflecting not just the sky above, but the sorrows and regrets of those who gaze into its depths. Legends speak of the lake as a mirror to the soul, where the most profound griefs are laid bare. Over time, the lake became a place of pilgrimage for the sorrowful and the lost, who believed that by offering their tears to the lake, they could find peace or perhaps even reunite with their departed loved ones.

However, the lake's power is double-edged. It is said that those who linger too long by its waters, or who pour too much of their sorrow into the lake, risk becoming one with it, their essence absorbed by the endless grief that pervades its depths. This is how the lake came to be associated with the Hollowed Saints, who, in their final moments, sought to cleanse their souls of despair by casting their tears into the lake, only to find themselves bound to it in undeath.

**Another Name:**

- **Lacrimara** (The Lake of Lament)

- **The Mirror of Sorrows**: This name reflects the lake’s mystical ability to reveal the innermost griefs of those who look into its waters. It is both a place of reflection and of danger, where one's tears can lead to unexpected consequences.

The Lake of Tears, with its dark allure and connection to the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints, remains a place of mystery and melancholy, where the past lingers like a shadow, and where the boundary between the living and the dead is as thin as the surface of the water.

### **The Cistern’s Corrupted Waters**

**Transformation and Corruption:**

The proximity of the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints to the **Lake of Tears** had a profound and dark influence on the water stored within the church’s cistern. Originally, the cistern was a sacred reservoir filled with holy water, believed to possess healing properties and spiritual purity. However, as the lake's sorrowful energy seeped into the surrounding land, the waters of the cistern began to change.

#### **1. Absorption of Sorrow:**

- The cistern, once a beacon of purity, became tainted by the lake’s sorrowful essence. The waters, intended to cleanse and sanctify, began to absorb the despair and lamentations that emanated from the Lake of Tears. Just as the lake reflected the grief of those who wept into it, the cistern’s waters became a vessel for that grief, carrying the weight of countless souls’ sorrow.

#### **2. The Saints' Desperation:**

- The Hollowed Saints, in their desperation to reconnect with the divine and rid themselves of the overwhelming despair, conducted forbidden rites over the cistern. They believed that by blending the sacred waters with the essence of the lake, they could channel both the power of the divine and the deep, emotional energy of the Lake of Tears. However, this act only further corrupted the waters, infusing them with both holy and cursed elements.

#### **3. Emergence of Curses:**

- The water in the cistern began to exhibit strange, malevolent properties. It no longer simply healed; it now twisted those who drank it, amplifying their grief and turning their sorrow into a curse. The once-pure water became a conduit for the lake’s dark influence, capable of binding souls to the church and hollowing them out, much like the cursed saints who guarded it.

#### **4. The Cistern’s New Nature:**

- The water now held within the cistern is a reflection of the lake’s sorrow, but with an added layer of sanctified corruption. It is imbued with the memories and regrets of those who poured their tears into the lake and the despair of the Hollowed Saints. Anyone who touches or drinks from the cistern’s water risks being overwhelmed by visions of loss and sorrow, slowly losing their sense of self as they are drawn into the same hollowed existence as the saints.

### **The Cistern’s Curse:**

The once holy cistern has become a dark mirror to the Lake of Tears, its waters no longer a source of purification but a trap for the unwary. While it still holds the potential for power—amplifying the strength of those who dare to drink from it—the price is steep. The water draws on the deepest sorrows of those who partake of it, binding them to the church and the lake, slowly turning them into hollowed, cursed beings. The cistern, like the Lake of Tears, is now a place where sorrow and sanctity are inextricably intertwined, and where the past’s grief continues to exert its malevolent influence.

The Hollowed Saints would have people weep into the waters, catch the water in the cistern and purify it, absolving people of their sins and guilt.
