## Risk Roll
You want to do something risky.
* Ask the team what could go wrong.
* Grab a light die for a skill
* Grab a light die for a Devil's Bargain
* Grab a dark die if you are willing to expose yourself to danger (Ritual requires a dark die). Sometimes this is required.
If any **DARK** die are greater than or equal to (>=)  your light die **AND** GREATER than your RUIN, mark one RUIN.

## Devil's Bargain
You lose something/take on a complication/something whack happens in exchange for a **light** die. It **has** to happen and **can not** negate success.

## Help
I wanna help. **NOTE: There has to be a DARK die in play, for someone to help.**
* Ask how is the helper exposed to danger?
* Add a light die
If your **LIGHT** die matches any **DARK** die in play. Take one RUIN.

## Combat
* Regular roll
* Ranged (up to 3) 1-3 lose slot 4-6 reduce endurance by one (can only be one)
* Rituals
* Retreat
* Risk rolls as combat
* Risk rolls in combat/to augment combat

### Additional Combat Rolls:
#### RISK ROLLS IN COMBAT
Rather than participating directly in the Combat Roll, you can attempt to weaken the monster
by making a Risk Roll. Say how you’re trying to weaken the monster, then make a Risk Roll as
normal. If your roll succeeds (highest die of 4, 5, or 6), you reduce the monster’s Endurance by 1. If you are using a Ritual as a part of your Risk Roll, see Rituals in Combat on the next page.
Using a Ritual can potentially reduce the monster’s Endurance by 2 (instead of just 1), but comes with the risk of being totally taken out of the Combat on a failed roll.

#### RANGED WEAPONS IN COMBAT
Ranged weapons—such as bows, crossbows, slings, and thrown weapons—can be treated as
any other weapon when used in combat. However, ranged weapons may be used to reduce
a monster’s Endurance by putting your ammunition—and the use of your weapon—at risk.
Ranged weapons start with 3 slots of ammunition. Make a Risk Roll to reduce Endurance as
normal, but add a light die for each unmarked slot of ammunition you’re willing to risk. For
each light die that comes up a 1, 2, or 3, mark a slot of ammunition. When you have no more
unmarked slots, you can no longer use this weapon. You can spend 1 Gold back in town to clear
all marks on a single ranged weapon.

#### RITUALS IN COMBAT
Rituals may be used two different ways in combat. Before the Combat Roll, declare whether
you’re using your magic to attempt to weaken the monster, or directly attack it.
For weakening, you may not directly participate in the Combat Roll. Instead, make a Risk Roll
as usual. In addition to the normal impact of the Risk Roll, if your highest die is a:
1–3: You don’t reduce the monster’s Endurance, and you also suffer some kind of consequence.
This might be exhaustion, magical backlash, a monster attack, or something else that prevents
you from engaging in the Combat Roll. You may continue to use other kinds of rolls to aid in
combat, however.
4–5: You reduce the monster’s Endurance by 1.
6: You reduce the monster’s Endurance by 2.

For a direct attack, you may be able to treat your Ritual as a weapon, rolling a Weak Point and
Combat Roll dice as usual. This is an especially risky use of magic, however, and the gm may
require you to make a Risk Roll before using your Ritual this way.
### RISK ROLL
When you attempt a risky task, say what you hope will happen and ask the GM and the other players what could possibly go wrong. Then gather 6-sided dice.

Take one light die if the task is something you would be able to do because of one of your Skills or piece of equipment. You only get one light die here, even if multiple Skills or pieces of equipment apply. If you don't have any relevant Skills or equipment, then you cannot take this die.

Take another light die for accepting a Devil's Bargain from another player or the GM. Devil's Bargains are complications that happen no matter the outcome of the roll. You can only accept one Devil's Bargain. See Devil's Bargains below.

Add a dark die if you are risking your mind or body to attempt the task. You must include this die whenever you perform a Ritual, or if the GM declares that it applies.

Roll the dice. If your highest die is a:

1-3: You fail, and things get worse. The GM describes how, which may or may not be connected to one of the ideas offered when you asked what could go wrong. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way.

4-5: You succeed, but there's some kind of complication. The GM describes the complication, then you describe how you succeed, or vice versa. The complication may be connected to one of the ideas offered when you asked what could go wrong, but it doesn't have to be.

6: You succeed. Describe how, or ask the GM to describe it.

If your highest die is a dark die, and the dark die is higher than your current Ruin, mark 1 Ruin. When you mark your last Ruin, you are lost--see Losing Yourself below.

If you are unhappy with your roll and your highest die is a light die, you may add a dark die to your dice pool and re-roll them all. You may keep adding a dark die and re-rolling until you're satisfied with your result or until your highest die is a dark die.


**THE FOREST'S RULE**
When dark and light dice are tied, the dark die is considered the highest.

### DEVIL'S BARGAINS
When you gather dice to make a Risk Roll, the GM or any other player can offer you a bonus light die if you accept a Devil's Bargain from them. Common Devil's Bargains include:

 - Causing collateral damage or unintended harm
 - Getting lost or separated from your companions
 - Sacrificing an item or piece of treasure
 - Betraying another character
 - Attracting unwanted attention

The Devil's Bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll. You make the deal, pay the price, and get the bonus die. The Devil's Bargain is always a free choice. If you don't like one, just reject it (or suggest how to alter it so you might consider taking it).

Anyone may veto or suggest alterations to a proposed Devil's Bargain, especially if it would also impact their character. You may only offer and accept Devil's Bargains when making a Risk Roll.

To streamline play during particularly tense moments (such as when using a Risk Roll while in combat), the GM may choose to allow only a single Devil's Bargain to be offered. They can pick the player to make the offer, or may simply make the offer themselves.

### HELP ROLL
If another player is making a Risk Roll that includes at least one dark die, you may offer help to improve their odds of success--either before or after they roll.

If they accept your offer, say how you expose yourself to danger and roll one light die.
They may include your light die's result when considering their overall success. But if your light die's result matches any of the dark dice in their roll, mark 1 Ruin. When you mark your last Ruin, you are lost--see Losing Yourself below.

You can only mark a maximum of 1 Ruin when helping on a roll. This is particularly relevant when a player re-rolls a Risk Roll. The helping player doesn't re-roll their light die. However, you still mark 1 Ruin if any re-rolled dice show the same number as your light die (provided you haven't marked 1 Ruin already due to this roll).

More than one player may offer to help, in which case each player rolls their own light die. The helped player can incorporate all of the light dice into their own Risk Roll.
### RUIN
Is your black die is **greater** than your RUIN, take RUIN
