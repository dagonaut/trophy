### Waterlogged Journal 
### The Words of Father Lorian

> “The air grows thick with sorrow, heavier each day. The lake no longer reflects the light; it only swallows it whole. The whispers speak of a reckoning—of saints no longer hallowed, but truly hollow. The tears will drown more than our hopes.”  
> _—Fragment of a sermon found near Evershade’s ruined chapel_

### The Corruption of the Lake

> “Once, pilgrims came to cleanse their grief. Now the lake drinks what it cannot give back. Those who linger hear their names whispered beneath the surface, as if the water remembers every tear ever shed.”  
> _—Recovered note, water-stained and signed only ‘L.’_

---

### The Drowned King’s Warning

> “Beware the marsh, where the king sleeps. His crown has rusted, but his sorrow has not. Step too close and he will make you bow.”  
> _—Scratched into a reed-wood tablet near the Mourning Stones_

### From a Hollowed Pilgrim’s Diary

> “We thought the saints took our grief into themselves to free us. But I saw their faces twist as they drank from the cistern. The tears they swallowed were not ours—they were the lake’s.”  
> _—Recovered from beneath a votive offering at the Ruined Church_

### Marginalia, Unsigned

> “The well beneath the village breathes when no one is near. It sighs in time with the waves on the lake. I think it dreams.”  
> _—Waterlogged Journal entry, ink run to illegibility near the end_

### The Choir Beneath the Water

They say the Hollowed Saints still sing, their voices carried through the water like echoes of old prayers. When the moon is full, you can hear them—drowned hymns rising from the depths of the lake. Those who listen too long find themselves humming the tune in their sleep, and waking with lungs full of brine.

> “The hymn is beautiful… until you realize it knows your name.”

### Offerings to the Well

The people of Evershade once left offerings at the Weeping Well—lockets, candles, even their own tears—to ease their grief. But the well grew greedy. Now, it keeps what is given. The candles burn longer, the lockets sink deeper, and the sorrow does not leave—it festers.

> “I left my sorrow in the water, and the water would not give it back.”

### The Last Blessing

Father Lorian believed the lake could still be redeemed. He blessed the waters with salt and song, but the salt blackened and the song turned to a scream. His body was never found—only his rosary, tangled in reeds, beads slick with tears that were not his own.

> “Faith sinks faster than stone.”

### The Reflection Pool

In the cistern, the water mirrors not what you are, but what you’ve lost. Pilgrims used to kneel before it, whispering confessions to their reflections. Now, the surface ripples on its own, showing faces that no longer exist in the world above.

> “I saw her face again. She smiled, but she was weeping.”

### The Lantern Maw

Lanterns once guided pilgrims through the Whispering Marshes—soft green lights, fed by glowmoss and prayer. But when the marsh took the faithful, the lights began to drift without masters, leading travelers into the water instead of out of it. Some say each lantern burns with the soul of a lost guide.

“They told us to follow the light. When we did, it followed us back.”
