He was a village priest in a time of famine and grief, when every family buried more children than it raised. He could not stand to see sorrow consume those around him, and so he began a ritual of listening\u2014truly listening. Each night, he would sit among the mourners, and ask them to speak their pain aloud. He would then pray, \u201cLet your grief be mine.\u201d</p> <p>At first it was metaphor.

The widow who came to him could smile again after years of weeping. The soldier who confessed his sins felt lighter. Yet Lorian\u2019s hair grew white before its time. His frame bent under invisible weight. His eyes became distant, as if haunted by a thousand ghosts.</p> <p>The people began to call him the Hollowed Saint, for he hollowed himself out to hold the grief of others. Pilgrims traveled to him, desperate to be unburdened. And still he said, \u201cLet it be mine instead.\u201d</p> <p>When he finally collapsed, he died smiling, whispering words no one heard clearly. Some say he saw a vision of heaven opening for him; others, that he saw only the bottomless well of human sorrow yawning wider still. His followers interred his bones with reverence and took up his practice. They built shrines, then churches, and finally the great cathedral. They sang the hymns he taught, believing that in emptying themselves of joy they could make a world free of grief.</p> <p>But Lorian had never intended for others to follow.

It is said that those who linger too long by its waters, or who pour too much of their sorrow into the lake, risk becoming one with it, their essence absorbed by the endless grief that pervades its depths.

Hollow. Fire. Blood.</p> <p>Origin and Identity:</p> <p>The invading force is known as The Shattered Legion, a once-powerful empire from the distant continent of Rhaskor. The Shattered Legion is a coalition of warlords, exiled nobility, and fragmented armies from a fallen empire that was destroyed in a cataclysmic event known as the Sundering.</p> <p>Claims to Kalduhr: ==What are the Shattered Legions claim to Kalduhr, how do they justify their campaign?==</p> <p>If they can\u2019t come up with anything: The leaders of the Shattered Legion believe that Kalduhr is the rightful successor to their lost empire. According to their ancient texts, Kalduhr was once part of a vast dominion ruled by their ancestors, long before the Sundering fractured their lands. They claim that Kalduhr was a sacred land, promised to them by the gods as a refuge and a place of rebirth for their fallen empire.</p> <p>The Shattered Legion is not a unified force but a loose coalition of warbands, each led by its own warlord. They are bound by a shared history of loss and a burning desire to reclaim their former glory, even if it means waging war against the rest of Kalduhr. They believe that the Sundering was not a random catastrophe but a divine punishment for the kingdom\u2019s hubris, and they now seek to atone through conquest and bloodshed.</p> <p>Conquest as appeasement (Religious Justification): The Shattered Legion also holds a deep religious belief that Kalduhr is the key to restoring their empire to its former glory. They believe that the blood of their ancestors, spilled in ancient wars, sanctified the soil of Kalduhr, making it a holy land. Their priests and prophets preach that only by conquering Kalduhr can they appease their gods and reverse the curse of the Sundering.</p> <p>Motivations for Invasion:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Restoration of Power: The Shattered Legion seeks to re-establish their empire by claiming Kalduhr as their new homeland. They see themselves as the rightful rulers of the world and believe that by taking Kalduhr, they can begin to rebuild their shattered dominion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Religious Zealotry: The Legion's invasion is also driven by fanatical zeal. They believe that Kalduhr is their divine inheritance, and they are willing to wage a holy war to claim it. Their leaders often invoke religious prophecies and ancient oaths to justify their conquest.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Desperation: The Sundering left the lands of Rhaskor barren and broken, driving the surviving remnants of the empire to seek new territories to sustain their people. Kalduhr, with its rich resources and ancient cities, represents their last hope for survival.</p> </li> </ol> <p>It\u2019s desperation first and foremost, but under a banner of religious zealotry and making Raskhor great again.</p> <p>Tactics and Approach:</p> <p>The Shattered Legion wages war with brutal efficiency, using a mix of ancient, arcane weaponry and disciplined military tactics. They are known for their relentless sieges, the use of dark magic to summon twisted creatures from the remnants of their broken homeland, and their ability to exploit the internal conflicts within Kalduhr to further their conquest. Their leaders are skilled in both warfare and manipulation, often using diplomacy and deceit to weaken their enemies before launching devastating attacks.</p> <p>The War\u2019s Impact on Kalduhr:</p> <p>The invasion has thrown Kalduhr into chaos, with its people caught between defending their homeland and the overwhelming might of the Shattered Legion. Cities have fallen, ancient alliances have been shattered, and the very land itself seems to groan under the weight of the conflict. The war has also sparked a resurgence of ancient magic and forgotten horrors, as both sides seek any advantage in their struggle for dominance.</p> <p>Reasons Some of the People of Kalduhr Support the Shattered Legion  </p> <ol> <li>Ancient Allegiances and Bloodlines:</li> </ol> <p>- Some noble houses in Kalduhr trace their lineage back to the time when their ancestors swore fealty to the empire from which the Shattered Legion descends. These families believe that supporting the Legion is an opportunity to reclaim lost honor, power, and prestige. They see the Legion as a means to restore what they view as a rightful order, where they once again hold significant influence.</p> <ol> <li>Religious Conviction:</li> </ol> <p>- The religious rhetoric of the Shattered Legion resonates with certain sects in Kalduhr who share similar beliefs. These groups see the Legion's invasion as a fulfillment of ancient prophecies and view their arrival as a divine test or a destined reunification. For them, opposing the Legion would be tantamount to defying the will of the gods.</p> <ol> <li>Dissatisfaction with Kalduhr's Leadership:</li> </ol> <p>- Years of war, internal strife, and ineffective leadership have left many in Kalduhr disillusioned with the ruling powers. Corruption, poverty, and oppression have eroded loyalty to the current rulers. For these people, the Shattered Legion represents change\u2014an alternative to the status quo, even if it comes at a high cost.</p> <ol> <li>Promises of Power and Wealth:</li> </ol> <p>- The Shattered Legion has made calculated promises to certain influential individuals and groups within Kalduhr, offering them power, land, and wealth in exchange for their support. These promises are especially tempting to those who feel marginalized or who have ambitions that cannot be realized under the current regime.</p> <ol> <li>Fear and Survival:</li> </ol> <p>- The Legion's reputation for ruthlessness and their overwhelming military might have led some communities to support them out of fear. They believe that by aligning with the invaders, they can avoid destruction and secure some measure of safety and stability for themselves and their families.</p> <ol> <li>Economic Opportunities:</li> </ol> <p>- The prolonged war has devastated many regions of Kalduhr, leading to economic hardship. The Shattered Legion offers opportunities for trade, mercenary work, and other economic activities that have become scarce. For some, collaboration with the Legion is simply a matter of survival and the hope for a better livelihood.</p> <ol> <li>Personal Grievances:</li> </ol> <p>- Some individuals and factions hold deep personal grudges against the rulers of Kalduhr, perhaps due to past injustices or conflicts. The Shattered Legion offers a chance for revenge and a way to settle old scores under the guise of supporting a larger cause.</p> <ol> <li>Desperation and Hopelessness:</li> </ol> <p>- The constant state of war and the toll it has taken on the people of Kalduhr have led some to lose hope in any peaceful resolution. They may view the Shattered Legion as the inevitable victors and believe that aligning with them, however reluctantly, is the only way to ensure their survival in a world that seems increasingly doomed.</p> <ol> <li>Manipulation and Deceit:</li> </ol> <p>- The Shattered Legion has actively engaged in propaganda and psychological warfare, spreading false information and manipulating perceptions to sow discord and win over key figures in Kalduhr. Some who support the Legion do so because they have been deceived into believing that the Legion's cause is just or that resistance is futile.</p> <ol> <li>Aspirations for Unity:</li> </ol> <p>- A minority in Kalduhr may genuinely believe that unification under the Shattered Legion could bring an end to the centuries of division and conflict within Kalduhr. They hope that, despite the cost, the Legion might bring about a stronger, more unified realm that could stand against future threats.</p>"},{"location":"jorando/Unsorted%20Ideas/","title":"Unsorted Ideas","text":"<ul> <li>More rings with cool effects</li> <li>More weapons and armor.

Their armor is cracked, their minds splintered, and their loyalty twisted into something monstrous.

Once combat begins, their coordination is eerie and unnerving. - Combat: Moderate to high difficulty \u2014 at least 4 Legionaries and 1 Elite Commander. - Special Danger: Legionaries fight in pairs, using synchronized attacks. Killing one enrages the other. The Commander can call reinforcements once during the battle unless his brazier is extinguished. - Environmental Threat: The brazier can explode if tampered with, dealing fire damage and summoning a ghostly horn blast that draws distant spirits from other parts of the village.</p> <p>Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing: Among the detritus of discipline gone to rot are the following: - Blacksteel Flanged Mace \u2013 Forged long ago, this mace strikes with precision and weight. On a critical strike, it knocks enemies prone. Still warm to the touch.   - Requisition Ledger \u2013 A brittle book with orders, names, and locations. When cross-referenced with clues from the Crumbling Diary or Faded Letter, it reveals the route to a hidden weapons cache buried under a ruined outpost east of the village.   - Phantom Commander's Sigil \u2013 A pendant once worn by the Legion's captain. When invoked during a moment of fear, it summons ghostly Legionnaires to fight by your side (1 black die in combat) \u2014but it costs 1 Ruin? as its echo feeds off your resolve.    </p>"},{"location":"jorando/sets/Whispering%20Marshes/items/Swamp%20Hag%27s%20Eye/","title":"Swamp Hag's Eye","text":"<p> A preserved eye of a swamp hag, suspended in murky liquid, its gaze both insightful and unsettling.</p> <p>\"Peer through it, and you may see beyond the veil\u2014but be prepared for what stares back.\"</p> <p>Effect: Gain 1 white die for divination rituals.
