Long ago, this body of water was known as Lacrimara , the Lake of Lament , a place where the mourners of the ancient world would come to grieve their dead. It was believed that the waters of the lake held the sorrow of the world, drawing in the tears of those who suffered, and in return, offering them solace. The lake's water is said to have a strange, ethereal quality, reflecting not just the sky above, but the sorrows and regrets of those who gaze into its depths. Legends speak of the lake as a mirror to the soul, where the most profound griefs are laid bare. Over time, the lake became a place of pilgrimage for the sorrowful and the lost, who believed that by offering their tears to the lake, they could find peace or perhaps even reunite with their departed loved ones. However, the lake's power is double-edged. It is said that those who linger too long by its waters, or who pour too much of their sorrow into the lake, risk becoming one with it, their essence absorbed by the endless grief that pervades its depths. This is how the lake came to be associated with the Hollowed Saints, who, in their final moments, sought to cleanse their souls of despair by casting their tears into the lake, only to find themselves bound to it in undeath. Another Name: Lacrimara (The Lake of Lament) The Mirror of Sorrows : This name reflects the lake\u2019s mystical ability to reveal the innermost griefs of those who look into its waters. It is both a place of reflection and of danger, where one's tears can lead to unexpected consequences. The Lake of Tears, with its dark allure and connection to the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints, remains a place of mystery and melancholy, where the past lingers like a shadow, and where the boundary between the living and the dead is as thin as the surface of the water. The Cistern\u2019s Corrupted Waters Transformation and Corruption: The proximity of the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints to the Lake of Tears had a profound and dark influence on the water stored within the church\u2019s cistern. Originally, the cistern was a sacred reservoir filled with holy water, believed to possess healing properties and spiritual purity. However, as the lake's sorrowful energy seeped into the surrounding land, the waters of the cistern began to change. 1. Absorption of Sorrow: The cistern, once a beacon of purity, became tainted by the lake\u2019s sorrowful essence. The waters, intended to cleanse and sanctify, began to absorb the despair and lamentations that emanated from the Lake of Tears. Just as the lake reflected the grief of those who wept into it, the cistern\u2019s waters became a vessel for that grief, carrying the weight of countless souls\u2019 sorrow. 2. The Saints' Desperation: The Hollowed Saints, in their desperation to reconnect with the divine and rid themselves of the overwhelming despair, conducted forbidden rites over the cistern. They believed that by blending the sacred waters with the essence of the lake, they could channel both the power of the divine and the deep, emotional energy of the Lake of Tears. However, this act only further corrupted the waters, infusing them with both holy and cursed elements. 3. Emergence of Curses: The water in the cistern began to exhibit strange, malevolent properties. It no longer simply healed; it now twisted those who drank it, amplifying their grief and turning their sorrow into a curse. The once-pure water became a conduit for the lake\u2019s dark influence, capable of binding souls to the church and hollowing them out, much like the cursed saints who guarded it. 4. The Cistern\u2019s New Nature: The water now held within the cistern is a reflection of the lake\u2019s sorrow, but with an added layer of sanctified corruption. It is imbued with the memories and regrets of those who poured their tears into the lake and the despair of the Hollowed Saints. Anyone who touches or drinks from the cistern\u2019s water risks being overwhelmed by visions of loss and sorrow, slowly losing their sense of self as they are drawn into the same hollowed existence as the saints. The Cistern\u2019s Curse: The once holy cistern has become a dark mirror to the Lake of Tears, its waters no longer a source of purification but a trap for the unwary. While it still holds the potential for power\u2014amplifying the strength of those who dare to drink from it\u2014the price is steep. The water draws on the deepest sorrows of those who partake of it, binding them to the church and the lake, slowly turning them into hollowed, cursed beings. The cistern, like the Lake of Tears, is now a place where sorrow and sanctity are inextricably intertwined, and where the past\u2019s grief continues to exert its malevolent influence. The Hollowed Saints would have people weep into the waters, catch the water in the cistern and purify it, absolving people of their sins and guilt.","title":"Lake of Tears Lore"},{"location":"jorando/Lake%20of%20Tears%20Lore/#the-cisterns-corrupted-waters","text":"Transformation and Corruption: The proximity of the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints to the Lake of Tears had a profound and dark influence on the water stored within the church\u2019s cistern.

Symbols/Themes: Desperation. Hollow. Fire. Blood. Origin and Identity: The invading force is known as The Shattered Legion , a once-powerful empire from the distant continent of [[Rhaskor]] . The Shattered Legion is a coalition of warlords, exiled nobility, and fragmented armies from a fallen empire that was destroyed in a cataclysmic event known as the Sundering. Claims to [[Kalduhr]]: ==What are the Shattered Legions claim to Kalduhr, how do they justify their campaign?== If they can\u2019t come up with anything: The leaders of the Shattered Legion believe that Kalduhr is the rightful successor to their lost empire. According to their ancient texts, Kalduhr was once part of a vast dominion ruled by their ancestors, long before the Sundering fractured their lands. They claim that Kalduhr was a sacred land, promised to them by the gods as a refuge and a place of rebirth for their fallen empire. The Shattered Legion is not a unified force but a loose coalition of warbands, each led by its own warlord. They are bound by a shared history of loss and a burning desire to reclaim their former glory, even if it means waging war against the rest of Kalduhr. They believe that the Sundering was not a random catastrophe but a divine punishment for the kingdom\u2019s hubris, and they now seek to atone through conquest and bloodshed. Conquest as appeasement (Religious Justification): The Shattered Legion also holds a deep religious belief that Kalduhr is the key to restoring their empire to its former glory. They believe that the blood of their ancestors, spilled in ancient wars, sanctified the soil of Kalduhr, making it a holy land. Their priests and prophets preach that only by conquering Kalduhr can they appease their gods and reverse the curse of the Sundering. Motivations for Invasion: Restoration of Power: The Shattered Legion seeks to re-establish their empire by claiming Kalduhr as their new homeland. They see themselves as the rightful rulers of the world and believe that by taking Kalduhr, they can begin to rebuild their shattered dominion. Religious Zealotry: The Legion's invasion is also driven by fanatical zeal. They believe that Kalduhr is their divine inheritance, and they are willing to wage a holy war to claim it. Their leaders often invoke religious prophecies and ancient oaths to justify their conquest. Desperation: The Sundering left the lands of Rhaskor barren and broken, driving the surviving remnants of the empire to seek new territories to sustain their people. Kalduhr, with its rich resources and ancient cities, represents their last hope for survival. It\u2019s desperation first and foremost, but under a banner of religious zealotry and making Raskhor great again. Tactics and Approach: The Shattered Legion wages war with brutal efficiency, using a mix of ancient, arcane weaponry and disciplined military tactics. They are known for their relentless sieges, the use of dark magic to summon twisted creatures from the remnants of their broken homeland, and their ability to exploit the internal conflicts within Kalduhr to further their conquest. Their leaders are skilled in both warfare and manipulation, often using diplomacy and deceit to weaken their enemies before launching devastating attacks. The War\u2019s Impact on Kalduhr: The invasion has thrown Kalduhr into chaos, with its people caught between defending their homeland and the overwhelming might of the Shattered Legion. Cities have fallen, ancient alliances have been shattered, and the very land itself seems to groan under the weight of the conflict. The war has also sparked a resurgence of ancient magic and forgotten horrors, as both sides seek any advantage in their struggle for dominance. Reasons Some of the People of Kalduhr Support the Shattered Legion Ancient Allegiances and Bloodlines: - Some noble houses in Kalduhr trace their lineage back to the time when their ancestors swore fealty to the empire from which the Shattered Legion descends. These families believe that supporting the Legion is an opportunity to reclaim lost honor, power, and prestige. They see the Legion as a means to restore what they view as a rightful order, where they once again hold significant influence. Religious Conviction: - The religious rhetoric of the Shattered Legion resonates with certain sects in Kalduhr who share similar beliefs. These groups see the Legion's invasion as a fulfillment of ancient prophecies and view their arrival as a divine test or a destined reunification. For them, opposing the Legion would be tantamount to defying the will of the gods. Dissatisfaction with Kalduhr's Leadership: - Years of war, internal strife, and ineffective leadership have left many in Kalduhr disillusioned with the ruling powers. Corruption, poverty, and oppression have eroded loyalty to the current rulers. For these people, the Shattered Legion represents change\u2014an alternative to the status quo, even if it comes at a high cost. Promises of Power and Wealth: - The Shattered Legion has made calculated promises to certain influential individuals and groups within Kalduhr, offering them power, land, and wealth in exchange for their support. These promises are especially tempting to those who feel marginalized or who have ambitions that cannot be realized under the current regime. Fear and Survival: - The Legion's reputation for ruthlessness and their overwhelming military might have led some communities to support them out of fear. They believe that by aligning with the invaders, they can avoid destruction and secure some measure of safety and stability for themselves and their families. Economic Opportunities: - The prolonged war has devastated many regions of Kalduhr, leading to economic hardship. The Shattered Legion offers opportunities for trade, mercenary work, and other economic activities that have become scarce. For some, collaboration with the Legion is simply a matter of survival and the hope for a better livelihood. Personal Grievances: - Some individuals and factions hold deep personal grudges against the rulers of Kalduhr, perhaps due to past injustices or conflicts. The Shattered Legion offers a chance for revenge and a way to settle old scores under the guise of supporting a larger cause. Desperation and Hopelessness: - The constant state of war and the toll it has taken on the people of Kalduhr have led some to lose hope in any peaceful resolution. They may view the Shattered Legion as the inevitable victors and believe that aligning with them, however reluctantly, is the only way to ensure their survival in a world that seems increasingly doomed. Manipulation and Deceit: - The Shattered Legion has actively engaged in propaganda and psychological warfare, spreading false information and manipulating perceptions to sow discord and win over key figures in Kalduhr. Some who support the Legion do so because they have been deceived into believing that the Legion's cause is just or that resistance is futile. Aspirations for Unity: - A minority in Kalduhr may genuinely believe that unification under the Shattered Legion could bring an end to the centuries of division and conflict within Kalduhr. They hope that, despite the cost, the Legion might bring about a stronger, more unified realm that could stand against future threats.","title":"The Shattered Legion"},{"location":"jorando/Unsorted%20Ideas/","text":"More rings with cool effects More weapons and armor.

Its waters remember everything. Its silence is never empty. Beneath the split flagstones of the Ruined Church lies the cistern: a once-holy reservoir now drowned in sanctified corruption. Pilgrims once descended these dripping stairs to draw water blessed by the Hollowed Saints, believing it could soothe grief and scour sickness. But the Lake of Tears seeped into its foundations, and the saints\u2014desperate, faithful, frightened\u2014blended sacred rites with the lake\u2019s sorrow. The water grew heavy and still. It began to mirror regret more readily than faces, and the stone learned to listen. Now the cistern reflects not grace but grief. The chambers hum with low hymns that have forgotten their words. Bones kneel in prayer that never ends. Every ripple carries a memory, whether you want it or not. The cistern does not forgive; it keeps. Goal Explore the cistern to uncover remnants of sacred rites. Withstand its emotional and spiritual corruption. Discover the passage that leads toward the deeper roots of the Lake (reclamation). Objective: Reach the depths of the cistern and cleanse or claim its heart. Discover: What became of the final saints who performed the forbidden rites. Complication: Any who touch the water risk the slow onset of the Hollowing Curse. Moments A ripple in the water mirrors your past, not your reflection. A soft chant echoes as if from inside the walls. The air turns cold when you speak your name aloud. A drowned priest speaks in bubbles from beneath the surface. A seal etched into the wall glows when sorrow is spoken aloud. A ripple moves opposite to your step. A broken mask floats on the surface of the cistern. Questions What memory returns to you when you see your reflection here? What part of you feels at home in the sorrow? What do you carry that might purify these waters\u2014or worsen them? What pain would you trade away if you could? Who among you carries a vial of the church\u2019s water from before it was corrupted? What vision of grief seizes you when you hear the water stir? The Hollowing Curse (Set Rule) Three tiers of exposure: Touch (scene): Skin contact or splashes mark Hollowing (Touch) . Until the scene ends, roll with disadvantage to resist despair/echo effects. Cleansed by intact salt circles, the Mitre (while active), or a true confession at the Altar. Drink (delve): A measured draught grants its listed boon and you gain 1 Burden: Thirst for Lament . While marked, the first failed resistance each scene also erases a pleasant memory (returns when cleansed). Cleanse at the Altar (purify path) or by using a Coin of Release . Immerse (persistent): Submersion marks Hollowing (Major) . Each time you speak your name, weep, or take a Ruin/Wear die here, advance a 3\u2011tick Hollowing clock . At 3 ticks, you draw the Wailbound or briefly take on their traits (GM move) until someone steadies you. Only the Lake\u2019s rite or an exorcism using a Dry Reliquary Shard removes it. Locations / Events 1) The Overflow Tunnel Originally a maintenance shaft, now a suffocating passage of wet stone and lingering prayers. Event: Water flows uphill while voices chant your name. Trap: A sudden reverse surge pins a character in place until another speaks a name they regret. Opportunity: A corroded valve wheel can be jammed to still the waters elsewhere (see Boss Weakness). Treasure: Sorrowbound Key hidden in a wall niche. 2) Sanctum of Salt Salt lines and dissolved relics mark a failed exorcism. Prop: Symbols of many forgotten faiths burned into the floor. Trap: Hallucinations overwhelm those who break the salt lines; each sees a different absolution offered at a terrible cost. Opportunity: Re-complete the circle with fresh salt (or bone ash) to create a temporary ward. Treasure: Tarnished Prayer Beads tangled around a rusted thurible. 3) The Saints\u2019 Reflection Pool A shallow basin where spectral saints silently observe\u2014faces eroded by time and tears. Event: One tries to speak a name from someone\u2019s backstory; on acceptance, gain guidance; on refusal, gain a Burden. Challenge: Drinking here shows the path ahead, but the drinker forgets a pleasant memory until the delve ends. Opportunity: Place a dry relic upon the water to briefly still the surface (see Boss Weakness). Treasure: Saint\u2019s Fragment wedged in the lip of the basin. 4) The Bone Grate A rusted iron grate blocks deeper tunnels. Skulls are stacked behind it like offerings. Lore: The last saint cast themselves into the water here; their mask is missing. Challenge: The grate will open only when a name is whispered that the speakers never shared in life. Treasure: Fragment of Lacrimara wedged between ribs, cold to the touch. 5) The Spiral Descent A narrow stair spiraling downward, slick with condensation. Challenge: Slippery steps and mournful echoes that disorient. Opportunity: Etched prayers on the walls can be traced to ward spirits for one scene. Encounter: Wailbound Acolytes performing a drowned rite. 6) Sanctified Reservoir (Heart Pool) A broad chamber where sorrow-tainted water gathers. Challenge: The water reflects each adventurer\u2019s regrets, sapping will (roll with disadvantage to resist despair). Opportunity: Drinking a measured draught (teaspoon, not cup) reveals a memory not your own\u2014usable once as a clue die. Event: A whisper travels across the surface repeating something only one character knows; following the sound reveals a hidden relief valve. 7) Altar of Blended Waters A crumbling dais where the saints performed their last rites. Challenge: Residual magic lashes out in waves of despair. Opportunity (Purify/Profane): Complete a rite with either clean water and a confession (purify) or lake-water and a denial (empower). Either course changes the boss. Treasure: Hollowed Relic beneath a slate tile; Waterskin of Cursed Water hanging from a hook. 8) Chamber of Hollowed Bones The resting place of the final saints. Bones carefully arranged in prayer. Challenge: Spirits stir if disturbed\u2014or if sorrow overwhelms the party. Opportunity: One saint\u2019s headpiece remains intact; wearing it suppresses the curse for a time. Treasure: Mitre of the Weeping Saint (see Items); Sorrowblade in a reliquary drawer. Props / Traps / Treasures (inline with locations) Salt circle segments, bone ash, censers, cracked fonts, drowned hymnals, relief valves, rusted valves, stacked skull-offerings, etched prayer-wards, broken masks. Baddies / Monsters / Adversaries Sorrow Eel (Swarm) \u2014 [CR low] Appearance: Blind, translucent eels that swim through both water and memory, leaving ripples across reflections. Abilities: Siphon of Sighs: On a hit, steal a recent relief; target rolls with disadvantage on morale checks this scene. Tide-Twist: Swarm displaces water, extinguishing flames and pushing characters. Weakness: Dryness\u2014desiccants or salt scatter them. Behavior (d6): 1) Circle silent confessions; 2) Nest in skulls; 3) Slip through grates; 4) Flop toward tears; 5) Hide in footprints; 6) Hunt to the rhythm of a hymn. Bone Rats of the Font \u2014 [CR low] Appearance: Slick, hairless rats with calcified spines; teeth stained blue by the water. Abilities: Gnaw the Ward: Chew through salt circles and prayer-scrolls. Pack Panic: Each additional rat imposes a mounting penalty to composure. Weakness: Sacred flame; flee from sudden bell chimes. Behavior (d6): 1) Drag relics; 2) Build nests in hymnals; 3) Scatter at names; 4) Drink upward-falling drips; 5) Offer bones to the pool; 6) Swarm a single, weeping target. Wailbound Acolyte \u2014 [CR medium] Appearance: Half-drowned worshipers bound in sodden vestments; voices echo from their chests rather than mouths. Abilities: Chant of Binding: Immobilize a target who speaks their own regret aloud. Borrowed Breath: Steal a gasp to heal. Weakness: The Choir\u2019s Hymn from the church or a true confession disrupts them. Behavior (d6): 1) Collect tears in chalices; 2) Scrape prayers into stone; 3) Harmonize with dripping water; 4) Guard the Altar; 5) Drown candles; 6) Follow the bearer of old church-water. Boss: The Weeping Echo (Saint-Collective) Description: The collective sorrow of the saints given shape\u2014shimmering, semi-transparent, stitched from tears and prayers. It assumes familiar silhouettes to each witness. Special Moves: Griefwave: A pulse of sadness forces visions of personal loss; on failure, lose your next action to mourning. Echoform: Takes the shape of one you mourn; attacks you with their last words. Liturgy of Undertow: The water itself obeys; each round the water level rises or falls precipitously. Weaknesses: Still Surface: Cannot be harmed unless the water is still. Freeze, salt, or mechanically still the pool (Overflow Tunnel valve; Saints\u2019 Reflection Pool relic). Dry Relic / Fire: Takes extra harm from items not yet touched by the lake (relics kept dry), open flame, or the Sacrificial Dagger during a rite. Reconciled Heart (Optional Subversion): A character who has made peace with a grief can \u201chold\u201d the Echo in their reflection for one turn, exposing it. Treasure: If the Echo is Purified at the Altar: Coin of Release + Reliquary Tear . If the Echo is Empowered (profane rite): Veil of the Weeping Echo + Ring of Echoes . Reliquary Rule (Church standard): Boss rewards are sealed and must be kept dry . If they are wetted by lake-water, flip to a Wept state (listed drawback applies) until ritually dried at the Church or by spending a confession. Reward details: Veil of the Weeping Echo (Wept: whispers linger) \u2014 Peek a heartbeat ahead. Once per scene, ask \u201cWhat sorrow comes next?\u201d and gain advantage on a related roll; then mark 1 whisper. At 3 whispers, the GM may echo one of your past laments aloud. Ring of Echoes (Wept: takes your words) \u2014 Bind a memory. Imprint a short phrase from a foe you heard here; 1\u00d7/delve, speak it to force hesitation or open a passage that responds to that phrase. If Wept, the ring sometimes speaks your words back at the worst moment. Coin of Release (Wept: melts to slag) \u2014 Spend to let go. One\u2011use: remove one Burden or clear Hollowing (Drink) from a willing target. If Wept, the coin dissolves after use and leaves a faint burn. Reliquary Tear (Wept: invites undertow) \u2014 Part sorrowful waters once. One\u2011use miracle: stills and parts a pool/flow in this set; counts as a dry relic vs. the boss. If Wept, the water surges back a moment sooner, imposing a scramble. Items (10\u201312) Hollowed Relic Description: A small, twisted idol that seems to drink sound. Mechanic: Channel grief into a powerful, unstable magical attack. Quote: \u201cThey worshiped absence more fervently than any god.\u201d Saint\u2019s Fragment Description: A shard of bone wrapped in decaying cloth.

Quote: \u201cBorn from the lake\u2019s first tear\u2014still wet with sorrow.\u201d Fragment of the Weeping Well Description: A broken rune-stone shard, still damp with memory. Mechanic: Speak a confession while holding it to reveal the nearest hidden passage; gain +1 Ruin. Quote: \u201cThe stone remembers what you would rather not.\u201d Mitre of the Weeping Saint Description: An ornate, water-stained headpiece lined with waxed felt. Mechanic: While worn, you are unseen by cursed entities when you remain silent . If splashed , the effect is suppressed for this scene. If fully submerged , flip to Damp Mitre (no effect) until dried and re\u2011waxed during a camp action or by holding it over the Censer of Mournful Incense . Speaking while the mitre touches lake\u2011water risks Hollowing (Touch) . Quote: \u201cShe covered her brow so grief could not crown her.\u201d Sorrowblade Description: A short, rusted blade that weeps blood-red water when drawn. Mechanic: Damage increases with the wielder\u2019s current Burdens.

Mechanic: Counts as a dry relic against the Boss; single-use to still a pool\u2019s surface. Quote: \u201cUnwept, unwatered\u2014unchanged.\u201d Valve-Wheel Talisman Description: A palm-sized bronze wheel engraved with prayer-teeth. Mechanic: When pressed to iron machinery, turns it silently and once; refreshes after a true confession. Quote: \u201cHands built the wheel; regrets turn it still.\u201d Boss Subversion / Methods of Progression Reconciliation Rite: Offer a true confession at the Altar of Blended Waters while holding the Fragment of the Weeping Well to part the reservoir for safe passage. Choir\u2019s Counter-Hymn: Perform the Choir\u2019s Hymn from the church to lull the Echo (requires hymn knowledge). Dry the Heart: Use salt, fire, or the Dry Reliquary Shard to still the heart-pool, exposing the Echo. Way Forward Upward to the Crypt via the spiral stair. To the Church through a sealed passage opened by the Sorrowbound Key. To the Lake via a flooded causeway revealed at low tide. Downward toward the bedrock roots and the lake\u2019s source.

The villagers were devoted followers of the church, and many of them worked as caretakers of the holy site, tending to the church\u2019s needs and supporting the pilgrims who came to seek solace in the lake\u2019s sorrowful waters. As the Invaders/Usurper's influence spread, the amount of mourners grew exponentially, but the nature of their sorrow had changed. Turned darker, more violent, seeking vengeance--not peace. The Village\u2019s Decline: Evershade began to decline as the influence of the Lake of Tears grew darker and more oppressive. The lake, once a source of solace, became a place of deepening sorrow. The villagers, who had long relied on the lake\u2019s waters and the church\u2019s blessings, found themselves slowly succumbing to despair. Crops withered, animals fell ill, and the once vibrant village became eerily quiet, as if the land itself was mourning. In their desperation, the villagers turned to the Hollowed Saints for guidance, but the saints themselves were falling into corruption. The rites and rituals meant to protect the village only deepened the curse that had taken root. Over time, the people of Evershade began to leave, seeking refuge in distant lands. Those who remained were eventually driven mad by the lake\u2019s influence, disappearing into the mists or succumbing to the hollowing curse that had claimed the saints. Current State: Evershade is now a ghostly ruin, shrouded in perpetual twilight. The village is overgrown with thick, gnarled vines and trees that block out the sun, casting everything in shadow. The once sturdy houses are now crumbling, their windows shattered and doors hanging ajar. The air is thick with the scent of decay and the faint echo of voices long gone. Notable Features: The Weeping Well: - At the center of the village stands an old well, known as the Weeping Well. The water within is tainted by the same sorrowful energy that affects the Lake of Tears. It is said that those who drink from it will be granted visions of the past, but they may also be overwhelmed by the grief that lingers in the village. The Forgotten Shrine: - Near the edge of the village lies a small, forgotten shrine dedicated to an unnamed deity. The shrine is covered in moss and ivy, with offerings left by the villagers before they abandoned the place. Some believe that this deity still watches over the village, its power diminished but not entirely gone. The Silent Graveyard: - Behind the village, a small graveyard holds the remains of those who died before the village\u2019s abandonment. The graves are marked with simple stones, many of which have been eroded by time. Ghostly figures are sometimes seen wandering among the graves, their forms flickering like candles in the wind. The Hollowed Tavern: - The village\u2019s once lively tavern is now a hollow shell, its interior filled with broken furniture and dust. The tavern was the last refuge of the remaining villagers, and their spectral forms can sometimes be seen inside, endlessly replaying the final days of the village. Folklore and Legends: The Curse of Evershade: It is said that the village\u2019s decline was not just due to the lake\u2019s influence but also because of a curse placed upon it by the Hollowed Saints. The curse was a punishment for the villagers\u2019 growing despair and loss of faith, dooming the village to eternal sorrow. The Last Pilgrim: A local legend speaks of a pilgrim who arrived in Evershade after the village had been abandoned. The pilgrim sought the relics of the Hollowed Saints but was never seen again. Some say that his ghost now haunts the village, searching for a way to lift the curse. Encounter Possibilities: Wandering Spirits: The village is haunted by the spirits of its former inhabitants, who are bound to the place by their sorrow. These spirits are not always hostile but can become dangerous if provoked or if they sense the adventurers\u2019 despair. Lost Relics: Evershade still holds relics of the church and the saints, hidden away in the ruins of homes and shrines. These items may provide clues to the village\u2019s past or offer power to those who dare to claim them. The Grieving Shade: A powerful spirit, known as the Grieving Shade, lingers in the village, drawn by the overwhelming sorrow that pervades the place. This entity seeks to consume the grief of others, growing stronger with each encounter. Conclusion: Evershade stands as a tragic reminder of the cost of despair and the dangers of losing hope. Its ruins are a testament to a time when faith was strong and the land was prosperous, but also to the darkness that can consume even the most devout when faced with overwhelming sorrow. Adventurers who explore the village may uncover its secrets, but they must tread carefully, lest they too fall victim to the same fate that claimed the villagers of Evershade. The Tunnel from the Weeping Well to the Cistern Purpose and Significance: The tunnel connecting the Weeping Well in the abandoned village of Evershade to the cistern beneath the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints was originally constructed for a sacred and practical purpose, but over time, it has taken on a darker role. Original Purpose: 1. Sacred Water Transport: Ritual Connection: The tunnel was initially created to facilitate the transport of holy water from the Lake of Tears to the church. The villagers of Evershade, who maintained the Weeping Well, would draw water from the lake and send it through the tunnel to the church\u2019s cistern. This water was used in various sacred rituals, blessings, and ceremonies, ensuring that the church always had a supply of what was once considered a divine, purifying substance. Spiritual Link: The tunnel symbolized the connection between the village and the church, as well as the bond between the people and the Hollowed Saints. It served as a physical and spiritual conduit, linking the village\u2019s devotion with the church\u2019s sanctity. 2. Pilgrimage and Secrecy: Hidden Pilgrimages: The tunnel allowed the most devout villagers to secretly access the church, even during times of strife or danger. Those who sought a private audience with the saints or who wished to perform penance could use the tunnel to reach the cistern, where they would offer prayers and tears directly to the saints. Transformation and Corruption: 1. Corruption of the Water: Tainted Flow: As the Lake of Tears grew darker and more sorrowful, the water that flowed through the Weeping Well and into the tunnel became tainted. The sorrowful energy of the lake, combined with the despair that began to permeate the village and the church, corrupted the water. The tunnel, once a passage of purity, became a channel of despair, carrying the lake\u2019s cursed essence directly to the cistern. Amplification of Curses: The Hollowed Saints, in their desperation to regain their lost power, began to use the tainted water in their dark rituals. The tunnel now served not just as a conduit for water, but as a passage for the lake\u2019s malevolent influence, amplifying the curses that bound the saints and the church. 2. Hidden Rites and Sacrifices: Forbidden Rituals: As the church\u2019s decline accelerated, the tunnel became the site of forbidden rites. Villagers and saints alike would use the tunnel to conduct secret rituals, hoping to reverse the curse that had befallen them. Sacrifices were made at the cistern\u2019s altar, and the tunnel\u2019s walls became stained with the remnants of these desperate acts. A Path to Damnation: Over time, the tunnel became a place of dread, where the boundary between life and death, sanity and madness, was perilously thin. The once sacred passage became a path to damnation, where those who entered risked being consumed by the same sorrow that had hollowed the saints. Current State: A Passage of Despair: The tunnel now serves as a hidden, treacherous passage between the abandoned village and the ruined church. It is a place of echoes and shadows, where the sorrows of the past linger in the air, and where the water that drips from the ceiling is thick with grief. The Final Journey: Some say that the tunnel is a place where the spirits of the lost and the damned are drawn, making one last journey from the village to the church, seeking redemption that will never come. Adventurers who discover the tunnel may use it to access the cistern, but they must be prepared to face the lingering curses and restless spirits that haunt its depths. Conclusion: The tunnel from the Weeping Well to the cistern is a relic of a time when the village and the church were united in faith and purpose. But as sorrow and despair took hold, the tunnel became a conduit for the very forces that led to their downfall. It stands as a hidden reminder of the dangers of unchecked grief and the lengths to which the desperate will go to reclaim lost glory, even if it means damning themselves in the process. 5 Items a Player May Find in the Tunnel: Forgotten Ritual Dagger - A ceremonial dagger used in the forbidden rites performed in the tunnel. Its blade is still sharp and imbued with dark energy. Damp Parchment Scroll - A scroll found tucked into a crack in the tunnel\u2019s wall.

Drinking it offers brief insight into the tunnel\u2019s history but risks madness. Tunnel Warden\u2019s Key - A large, iron key once used by the caretaker of the tunnel.

Ivy coils tightly around its frame, as if trying to hold the structure together. The bell itself, cracked and silent, hangs askew from a frayed rope that sways in windless air. Below, the steps leading up are slick with moss and water, and the ground is strewn with rotting prayer ribbons and faded etchings of names long forgotten. This was once the place where vows were spoken\u2014and broken.

Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing: - Proper Offering : Placing a meaningful token of grief (like the Silver Locket , Faded Love Letter , or a personal item tied to backstory) on the altar may do one of the following: - Reveal a moment of memory : a vision of the village before it fell, showing the hidden path to the Weeping Well. - Temporarily calm all spirits in the area for one scene. - Call forth the Last Pilgrim in a non-hostile form , willing to answer one question. - Writ of Forgotten Rites : Hidden beneath a cracked stone tile at the shrine\u2019s base is a weathered scroll describing how to sanctify cursed ground .

Clad in tattered, once-ceremonial robes that flutter in the wind, the Pilgrim\u2019s face is obscured by a weathered hood and a metal mask resembling a weeping visage. Their hands are gloved and clutch a staff topped with an intricately carved symbol of a fallen star, a relic of forgotten rituals. Background: The Last Pilgrim was once a devout guardian of the sacred rites that governed Evershade. When the village fell to ruin and the Shattered Legion\u2019s invasion disrupted their duties, they became a solitary figure, desperately trying to uphold the lost traditions and protect what remains of the village\u2019s sanctity. Now, they wander the ruins, seeking to restore the village\u2019s honor or, failing that, to ensure its secrets remain undisturbed. Abilities: Blessing of the Forgotten: The Pilgrim channels ancient rites to invoke protective wards that create barriers of spiritual energy, reducing incoming damage by 50% and making it difficult for enemies to approach. Wail of Desolation: The Pilgrim emits a mournful wail that echoes through the ruins, causing nearby enemies to suffer a -2 penalty to their attack rolls and forcing them to make a Willpower check or become disoriented for one turn. Spectral Conjure: With a sweep of their staff, the Pilgrim summons spectral apparitions that can harass and distract foes. These apparitions deal minor psychic damage and cause confusion, imposing a -1 penalty on rolls related to combat or decision-making. Sacred Rebirth: When reduced to half HP, the Pilgrim can perform a ritual that temporarily shields them from harm, regaining 10% of their total HP and gaining a +1 bonus to their defense rolls for the next turn. Weaknesses: Burdened by Duty: The Pilgrim is driven by their sense of responsibility and can become fixated on protecting certain locations or artifacts, making them less responsive to threats outside their immediate focus. Emotional Vulnerability: The Pilgrim\u2019s resolve is tied to the village\u2019s fate, and they are deeply affected by any desecration or disruption of sacred sites. Actions that mock or threaten their mission can cause them to lose focus, imposing a -2 penalty to their abilities for a short period. Treasure and Rewards: Pilgrim\u2019s Staff: A magical staff that enhances the wielder's spiritual abilities, granting +2 to rolls related to protective spells and rituals. Mask of the Weeping Visage: A mask that, when worn, provides resistance to fear-based effects and grants the wearer the ability to sense nearby magical disturbances. Last Pilgrim\u2019s Cloak: A tattered cloak that offers +1 to defense rolls and has a chance to temporarily conceal the wearer in shadows, making them harder to hit in combat. The Last Pilgrim: An invasion! Clad in tattered, once-ceremonial robes that flutter in the wind, the Pilgrim\u2019s face is obscured by a weathered hood and a metal mask resembling a weeping visage. Their hands are gloved and clutch a staff topped with an intricately carved symbol of a fallen star, a relic of forgotten rituals. - Trigger: Taking anything from his alter at the Forgotten Shrine Lore: The Last Pilgrim is a tragic remnant of Evershade\u2019s once-sacred order. Their presence is a poignant reminder of the village\u2019s lost glory and the profound sense of duty that bound its people. As they wander the ruins, their quest remains\u2014to either reclaim their lost heritage or to ensure that the village\u2019s secrets are preserved, even if it means facing those who now intrude upon their sacred ground.

Time and moisture have erased most names, but the sorrow here lingers. The air is unusually still\u2014no birds, no insects, no breeze. Only the occasional creak of old trees or the sudden cry of a mourning spirit breaks the silence.

[[Gravemind Rootsnare]] : In one overgrown corner, tree roots coil around half-sunken graves. If blood or emotion is spilled nearby, they animate as a semi-sentient tangle that lashes out.

Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing: The Summoning of the Last Pilgrim : One weather-worn grave bears a strange, shimmering red sigil \u2014barely visible except in certain light. Touching the stone with bare flesh while carrying an item of grief (e.g., the [[Mourner\u2019s Veil]] , [[Grief-Worn Doll]] , or [[Faded Love Letter]] ) causes [[The Last Pilgrim]] to appear, slowly walking from behind a row of graves as if stepping from memory itself. Optional Twist : If summoned with respect (e.g., through grief), the Pilgrim may not attack, instead issuing a warning or offering a test. If summoned through theft or violence, the Pilgrim arrives enraged. Gravestone of Liorna : Half-covered in ivy, the stone reads only: \u201cShe waited at the lake, even as it forgot her name.\u201d Those holding the [[Silver Locket of Eternal Vows]] may receive a whispered message from her spirit here.

When used at [[Weeping Well]], it grants temporary immunity to curses but causes sorrowful hallucinations for a day.

Unlike the cursed and sorrowful spirits that haunt the area, the Stone Sentinel is a being of pure, unwavering resolve, impervious to the emotions that plague the living. Its body is formed from large, jagged stones, bound together by glowing runes that pulse with an inner light. Moss and vines have grown over its surface, giving it a semblance of age and permanence, as if it has stood guard for centuries. The golem has been chiseled to resemble a knight in armor, though upon closer look, it is a single piece of solid stone. It wields a massive sword in one hand, made of the same stone. The Stone Sentinel patrols the ruins of Evershade, crushing any who dare to disturb the cursed grounds it was created to protect. Trophy Gold Mechanics: - Attack: Crushing Blow \u2013 The Stone Sentinel brings down its massive hammer with earth-shattering force, dealing devastating damage to a single target. If the target is not able to dodge or deflect the blow, they are knocked prone and stunned. - Special: Unyielding Defense \u2013 The golem raises its stone shield, creating an impenetrable barrier that absorbs all incoming attacks for a short period. During this time, the Stone Sentinel is nearly invulnerable, and players must find a way to outmaneuver or outlast this defense. - Environmental Hazard: Tremor \u2013 When the Stone Sentinel moves, it causes the ground to quake, creating tremors that can knock players off their feet or cause parts of the ruins to collapse, creating additional hazards in the battlefield. - Weakness: Cracked Core \u2013 While the Stone Sentinel is impervious to despair, its body has a hidden flaw: a cracked core within its chest. Players must discover this weakness during the fight and target it directly to deal significant damage. Doing so requires precise timing and coordination, as the core is only exposed during certain attack sequences. Treasures: Heartstone of the Sentinel (Amulet) \u2013 A small shard of the Stone Sentinel\u2019s core, still faintly glowing with magical energy. When worn, it grants the wearer resistance to physical damage but makes them more vulnerable to magical attacks. The Heartstone also provides the wearer with a temporary shield that can absorb a single powerful blow. Sword of Evershade (Weapon) \u2013 The Stone Sentinel\u2019s massive stone sword, now imbued with the lingering magic of the golem. While incredibly heavy, it deals massive damage and can cause tremors with each strike. The sword is difficult to wield effectively without great strength. Sentinel\u2019s Aegis (Armor) \u2013 A piece of the Stone Sentinel\u2019s body, reforged into a durable armor plate. It provides exceptional protection against physical attacks and has the ability to briefly create a magical barrier, reflecting a portion of the damage back to attackers.

The air is heavy with the scent of decay, and the echoes of past lives seem to linger in the shadows. Goals: Uncover the secrets to find the [[Weeping Well]] and the hidden tunnel to [[The Cistern]] Find your way to the coast and figure out passage across the [[Lake of Tears]]. Questions: Moments: tell me about the feel of this place? Wet. Abandoned. Ethereal music plays. Note Found: \u201cThe air grows thick with sorrow, heavier each day. The lake no longer reflects the light; it only swallows it whole. The whispers speak of a reckoning, of shadows creeping from the marshes, of saints no longer hallowed but truly hollow. The tears will drown more than just our hopes. May the gods have mercy on our souls.\u201d -Father Lorian Locations / Traps / Opportunities: The Hollowed Tavern Once a lively gathering place, the tavern is now a hollow shell, filled with broken furniture and the faintest echoes of laughter. Spirits of the villagers sometimes manifest here, replaying their final moments. * What are the spirirts/shades doing? The Silent Graveyard A small, overgrown graveyard behind the village. The graves are marked with simple stones, and the air is thick with the presence of restless spirits. * There is a shimmering red sign on a gravestone. You can touch this to summon the Pilgrim (this is a different interaction than if you stole something) * Describe a gravestone... how does it relate to your story? The Forgotten Shrine Near the edge of the village lies a small, forgotten shrine dedicated to an unnamed deity. The shrine is covered in moss and ivy, with offerings left by the villagers before they abandoned the place. Some believe that this deity still watches over the village, its power diminished but not entirely gone. * Trap: Taking something from the alter summons [[The Last Pilgrim]] - Describe the final offerings... or what's left of them The Bell Tower once a symbol of hope, now stands crumbling and silent. Its bell, tarnished and cracked, no longer rings. Ivy and decay have overtaken the stone, hiding the secrets of forgotten vows. Beneath its shadow, echoes of the village's tragic past linger, waiting to be uncovered. Shattered Legion Camp A small camp with Shattered Legion troops. * Difficult fight with multiple assailants * Extra treasure (weapons, healing, rolls from the list) Baddies/Hazards: The Restless Spirits: Villagers who died in despair, their spirits wander the village, lashing out at those who disturb their sorrowful rest. Shattered Legion camp The Last Pilgrim This is a special encounter Description: The Last Pilgrim is a gaunt, enigmatic figure who roams the desolate remnants of Evershade, driven by a singular, unwavering purpose. Clad in tattered, once-ceremonial robes that flutter in the wind, the Pilgrim\u2019s face is obscured by a weathered hood and a metal mask resembling a weeping visage. Their hands are gloved and clutch a staff topped with an intricately carved symbol of a fallen star, a relic of forgotten rituals. Background: The Last Pilgrim was once a devout guardian of the sacred rites that governed Evershade. When the village fell to ruin and the Shattered Legion\u2019s invasion disrupted their duties, they became a solitary figure, desperately trying to uphold the lost traditions and protect what remains of the village\u2019s sanctity. Now, they wander the ruins, seeking to restore the village\u2019s honor or, failing that, to ensure its secrets remain undisturbed. Abilities: Blessing of the Forgotten: The Pilgrim channels ancient rites to invoke protective wards that create barriers of spiritual energy, reducing incoming damage by 50% and making it difficult for enemies to approach. Wail of Desolation: The Pilgrim emits a mournful wail that echoes through the ruins, causing nearby enemies to suffer a -2 penalty to their attack rolls and forcing them to make a Willpower check or become disoriented for one turn. Spectral Conjure: With a sweep of their staff, the Pilgrim summons spectral apparitions that can harass and distract foes. These apparitions deal minor psychic damage and cause confusion, imposing a -1 penalty on rolls related to combat or decision-making. Sacred Rebirth: When reduced to half HP, the Pilgrim can perform a ritual that temporarily shields them from harm, regaining 10% of their total HP and gaining a +1 bonus to their defense rolls for the next turn. Weaknesses: Burdened by Duty: The Pilgrim is driven by their sense of responsibility and can become fixated on protecting certain locations or artifacts, making them less responsive to threats outside their immediate focus. Emotional Vulnerability: The Pilgrim\u2019s resolve is tied to the village\u2019s fate, and they are deeply affected by any desecration or disruption of sacred sites. Actions that mock or threaten their mission can cause them to lose focus, imposing a -2 penalty to their abilities for a short period. Treasure and Rewards: Pilgrim\u2019s Staff: A magical staff that enhances the wielder's spiritual abilities, granting +2 to rolls related to protective spells and rituals. Mask of the Weeping Visage: A mask that, when worn, provides resistance to fear-based effects and grants the wearer the ability to sense nearby magical disturbances. Last Pilgrim\u2019s Cloak: A tattered cloak that offers +1 to defense rolls and has a chance to temporarily conceal the wearer in shadows, making them harder to hit in combat. The Last Pilgrim: An invasion! Clad in tattered, once-ceremonial robes that flutter in the wind, the Pilgrim\u2019s face is obscured by a weathered hood and a metal mask resembling a weeping visage. Their hands are gloved and clutch a staff topped with an intricately carved symbol of a fallen star, a relic of forgotten rituals. - Trigger: Taking anything from his alter at the Forgotten Shrine Lore: The Last Pilgrim is a tragic remnant of Evershade\u2019s once-sacred order. Their presence is a poignant reminder of the village\u2019s lost glory and the profound sense of duty that bound its people. As they wander the ruins, their quest remains\u2014to either reclaim their lost heritage or to ensure that the village\u2019s secrets are preserved, even if it means facing those who now intrude upon their sacred ground. Boss: [[The Stone Sentinel of Evershade]] (Endurance 10) The Stone Sentinel is a towering golem crafted from the very stones of Evershade, brought to life by ancient magic to protect the village from the despair that has consumed the land. Unlike the cursed and sorrowful spirits that haunt the area, the Stone Sentinel is a being of pure, unwavering resolve, impervious to the emotions that plague the living. Its body is formed from large, jagged stones, bound together by glowing runes that pulse with an inner light. Moss and vines have grown over its surface, giving it a semblance of age and permanence, as if it has stood guard for centuries. The golem has been chiseled to resemble a knight in armor, though upon closer look, it is a single piece of solid stone. It wields a massive sword in one hand, made of the same stone. The Stone Sentinel patrols the ruins of Evershade, crushing any who dare to disturb the cursed grounds it was created to protect. Trophy Gold Mechanics: - Attack: Crushing Blow \u2013 The Stone Sentinel brings down its massive hammer with earth-shattering force, dealing devastating damage to a single target. If the target is not able to dodge or deflect the blow, they are knocked prone and stunned. - Special: Unyielding Defense \u2013 The golem raises its stone shield, creating an impenetrable barrier that absorbs all incoming attacks for a short period. During this time, the Stone Sentinel is nearly invulnerable, and players must find a way to outmaneuver or outlast this defense. - Environmental Hazard: Tremor \u2013 When the Stone Sentinel moves, it causes the ground to quake, creating tremors that can knock players off their feet or cause parts of the ruins to collapse, creating additional hazards in the battlefield. - Weakness: Cracked Core \u2013 While the Stone Sentinel is impervious to despair, its body has a hidden flaw: a cracked core within its chest. Players must discover this weakness during the fight and target it directly to deal significant damage. Doing so requires precise timing and coordination, as the core is only exposed during certain attack sequences. Treasures: Heartstone of the Sentinel (Amulet) \u2013 A small shard of the Stone Sentinel\u2019s core, still faintly glowing with magical energy. When worn, it grants the wearer resistance to physical damage but makes them more vulnerable to magical attacks. The Heartstone also provides the wearer with a temporary shield that can absorb a single powerful blow. Sword of Evershade (Weapon) \u2013 The Stone Sentinel\u2019s massive stone sword, now imbued with the lingering magic of the golem. While incredibly heavy, it deals massive damage and can cause tremors with each strike. The sword is difficult to wield effectively without great strength. Sentinel\u2019s Aegis (Armor) \u2013 A piece of the Stone Sentinel\u2019s body, reforged into a durable armor plate. It provides exceptional protection against physical attacks and has the ability to briefly create a magical barrier, reflecting a portion of the damage back to attackers. The armor is heavy and reduces the wearer\u2019s mobility. Items/Treasure: Treasures: Prioritize: Faded Love Letter; Crumbling Diary; Grief-Worn Doll A child\u2019s doll, frayed and worn, with glassy eyes that seem to watch.

Beneath the old bell tower, where our vows were whispered to the winds, I have left something for you\u2014something to remember me by, should the darkness take us both. Follow the path we walked that autumn day, when the leaves were golden and the world was ours. I\u2019ll wait for you there, in the place where we promised forever. Yours, Alaric Echoing Bell A small, silver bell that, when rung, causes distant, sorrowful sounds to echo through the village. Mechanic: It can be used to attract or repel spirits.

Censer of Lament An ancient censer found in the Hollowed Tavern. When lit, it calms hostile spirits but induces sorrowful visions in those who carry it. Silver Locket of Eternal Vows The locket is small and intricately crafted, its surface engraved with delicate patterns of entwined vines and flowers. Time has tarnished the silver, but a faint glow emanates from the locket, as if it still holds the warmth of the love that once filled it. Inside, there are two tiny portraits\u2014one of Alaric and the other of Liora\u2014painted with exquisite detail. Beneath the portraits, folded within the locket, is a dried, pressed flower, the same kind that bloomed in Evershade before the village fell into ruin. Properties: - Whisper of the Past: When held close, the locket allows the wearer to hear faint echoes of conversations and memories from those who once lived in Evershade. This can be used to uncover hidden secrets or gain insight into the village's past. - Guiding Light: In times of danger or darkness, the locket emits a soft, guiding light, illuminating the path ahead and helping the wearer navigate treacherous areas. - Bound by Love: The locket carries a powerful emotional resonance. It grants the wearer resistance to fear-based effects and despair, as it serves as a reminder of love\u2019s enduring strength, even in the face of overwhelming darkness. Lore: The locket was a gift from Alaric to Liora, a symbol of their eternal love and the vows they made to each other. Though they were separated by the tragic events that befell Evershade, the locket remains a testament to their bond, imbued with the lingering essence of their devotion. Usage: The player can use the Silver Locket of Eternal Vows as a tool for exploration and protection. It may also play a role in unraveling the deeper mysteries of Evershade, as the memories it reveals could provide crucial clues to the village's downfall and the fate of its inhabitants.

Beneath the portraits, folded within the locket, is a dried, pressed flower, the same kind that bloomed in Evershade before the village fell into ruin. Fun fact: Those flowers still bloom near her grave and the [[The Bell Tower]] Properties: - Whisper of the Past: When held close, the locket allows the wearer to hear faint echoes of conversations and memories from those who once lived in Evershade. This can be used to uncover hidden secrets or gain insight into the village's past. - Guiding Light: In times of danger or darkness, the locket emits a soft, guiding light, illuminating the path ahead and helping the wearer navigate treacherous areas. - Bound by Love: The locket carries a powerful emotional resonance. It grants the wearer resistance to fear-based effects and despair, as it serves as a reminder of love\u2019s enduring strength, even in the face of overwhelming darkness. Lore: The locket was a gift from Alaric to Liora, a symbol of their eternal love and the vows they made to each other. Though they were separated by the tragic events that befell Evershade, the locket remains a testament to their bond, imbued with the lingering essence of their devotion. ==Alaric was taken, what were the circumstances?== This is a Clue and Key item","title":"A Silver Locket"},{"location":"jorando/sets/Evershade/items/Tunnel%20Warden%E2%80%99s%20Key/","text":"A heavy iron key with a twisted grip and three turquoise stones embedded in its bow, said to resonate faintly in the presence of hidden doors.

The Lake of Tears, once sacred, has become tainted, its surface reflecting not light but loss. Inside, decay reigns. The Hollowed Saints who once absolved grief now guard their reliquary with cursed fervor. Their faith twisted by despair, they remain bound to the church and its crypt. The Weeping Well beneath, fed by underground springs and sorrow, connects to the Cistern, and carries with it whispers of the church's final days. Goals Objective : Retrieve the Reliquary of the Hollowed Saints from the crypt beneath the church. Discover : The path to the Cistern (if arriving from [[Evershade]] by crossing the Lake). Complication : The reliquary is guarded by cursed saints whose souls are bound to it. Moments A hymn echoes from nowhere and everywhere. A statue's face shifts to resemble someone in the party. Water drips upward from the floor into cracks in the ceiling. Questions/Paint the Scene What memory of faith have you buried? Who in the party once prayed to the Hollowed Saints? What part of the church feels strangely untouched by time? Events The saints stir as the reliquary is approached. A forgotten prayer book opens on its own. A scream echoes from the Cistern entrance. The twisted tree in the nave bleeds sap when touched. Locations / Traps / Opportunities The Overgrown Courtyard Challenges : Razor Vines lash out when disturbed.

Now, she is a spectral figure who haunts the well, her eyes hollow and her mouth sewn shut to prevent her from speaking the horrors she has seen. Her presence causes the waters of the well to ripple with dark energy, and her very touch can show a person their darkest future. Weaknesses : * Cannot see you if you show no sorrow. - Echoes of the Past \u2013 The Seer can be weakened by playing an ancient melody that was once sung in the village. Players must find a way to reproduce this melody to disrupt her powers. [[Broken Music Box]] Abilities : - Causes visions of past grief. Absorbs spoken confessions to empower itself. - Curse of Silence \u2013 The Seer can curse a player, rendering them unable to speak or cast spells. This curse can only be lifted by defeating her or using a rare item found in the well (Mourner's Signet). Chart of Interesting Things (d6) : 1. Offers you a truth you didn\u2019t ask for 2.

It also provides resistance to mind-affecting spells. - Ring of Echoes (Accessory) \u2013 A silver ring that allows the wearer to communicate telepathically with others but slowly causes them to hear the thoughts of everyone around them, leading to potential madness.","title":"Seer of the Well"},{"location":"jorando/sets/Weeping%20Well/The%20Hidden%20Tunnel/","text":"The stone seal grinds open into a narrow passage, just wide enough to squeeze through sideways.

Stale air presses on your chest like a hand. Along the curved walls are crumbling book alcoves, rusted chains, and half-melted wax figures frozen mid-supplication. An altar of bone-white marble pulses faintly\u2014its surface cracked, but still warm. Faint breaths echo here, though no one speaks. Some say the Hollowed Saints were undone here\u2014whispered empty by rites they could no longer bear. Once a sacred chamber for troubled priests of the Hollowed Church, the Murmuring Cell is a small, windowless room beneath the altar at the Ruined Church. Its walls are carved with a thousand tiny confessions, some scratched in with bloodied nails, others carefully etched as prayers. At its center is a small iron stand, black with soot, made to hold a single candle. Here, the broken and burdened came to speak aloud the horrors they had witnessed\u2014visions, sins, doubts\u2014and by doing so, cleanse themselves. Or so the Church claimed. The truth is more complex: some left the chamber renewed, others hollowed, their burdens lifted but their minds frayed. It was not only a place of confession, but of punishment disguised as penance. The Candle of Remorse was always lit here. It still waits on its stand. \"Speak, and you may walk free. But some things, once spoken, do not leave you.\" This is a place where Priests that were having trouble went to speak the horrors they learned and renew their vows and devotion to the Hollowed Church. You spoke it to remove it from yourself. It seems penitent, but perhaps its punitive. Paint the Scene Ask the players: - What object in this room reminds you of something buried\u2014emotionally or literally? - What faint phrase do you think you hear repeated again and again? - What item in this room do you know, without doubt, should not be touched? - Imagine you could carve stone with your own breath... how long would that take? Traps / Effects Lingering Breath : Anyone who lingers here too long begins to exhale frost, even in the warm air. This breath carries their secrets into the room, where they might manifest. Effect : Gain +1 Ruin if you speak aloud here. Those who whisper may attract something waiting. Grief Mirror : A dusty shard of obsidian set into the altar reveals not your reflection, but the moment you last wept. Effect : Staring too long forces a Willpower check or risk hallucinating a conversation with the person you mourned. The Hung Chain : One rusted chain dangles from the ceiling, swaying though no wind blows. If grasped, it burns the palm\u2014and shows a brief, psychic flash of a forgotten Hollowed rite. Effect : Lose 1 HP, but gain insight into a hidden passage or puzzle (e.g. Gate of Names or Cistern mechanism). Secrets & Interactions Dust-Covered Manuscript sits beneath the altar in a bowl of salt and ash. Mechanic : Once per delve, roll to invoke a Forbidden Miracle (see Seer of the Well). Gain 1 Ruin. Interaction Table : May reveal itself by light of the Candle of Remorse , or whisper a miracle when the Tearcatch Flask is spilled nearby. Blood-Slicked Censer hangs in the alcove.

Its limbs twist and surge with unnatural flow, and its face is a drowned echo\u2014blurred, weeping, and shifting between the forms of those its victims once loved. Abilities: Grief Current: The Drowner drags a target toward it with a tendril of water. On a failed check, the target is pulled into melee range and suffers a -1 to their next action due to breathlessness and panic. Echo Drown: Once per encounter, the Drowner mimics the voice of a loved one lost, forcing nearby players to pass a Willpower check or be stunned for one turn as their grief resurfaces. Floodform: When bloodied, the Drowner collapses into a wave and reforms elsewhere in the room, gaining a +1 to evade rolls until struck again. Weakness: Cannot enter sanctified ground or cross running water. If confronted with its true name (sometimes whispered by spirits near the Moss-Runed Stone ), it becomes vulnerable for one turn. Behavior (d6): 1. Clings to walls, whispering regrets in voices not its own. 2. Drowns votive offerings left at the base of the well. 3. Stalks silently just beyond the edge of torchlight. 4. Leaves puddles shaped like weeping figures. 5. Mimics sobbing until someone comes close. 6.

The air grows colder with every step, thick with the scent of wet stone and faded incense. The only sound is water dripping\u2026 from somewhere far below, or perhaps from your own eyes.

The Tunnel Entrance Hidden beneath the well, marked by ancient runes that glow faintly with cursed energy. - Trap : Opening the tunnel without understanding the runes triggers a psychic scream. The Hidden Tunnel A dark, damp passage connecting the Weeping Well to the cistern beneath the Ruined Church of the Hollowed Saints. The walls are slick with moisture, and the air is thick with the stench of decay and the echo of distant weeping. The path is narrow and treacherous, with many places where the walls seem to close in. - Treasure : The Mourner\u2019s Signet (see Items) The Forgotten Chamber A small, secret room branching off the tunnel. Used long ago by Hollowed Saints for forbidden rites. Its walls are lined with crumbling books, rusted ritual implements, and an altar that glows faintly with lingering corruption. - Treasure : Dust-Covered Manuscript (usable once for a forbidden miracle or spell), Blood-Slicked Censer (draws Wailbound closer when swung) Boss: Seer of the Well Description : The Seer was once a prophetess who could see the future, but the power of the well twisted her visions into nightmares. Now, she is a spectral figure who haunts the well, her eyes hollow and her mouth sewn shut to prevent her from speaking the horrors she has seen. Her presence causes the waters of the well to ripple with dark energy, and her very touch can show a person their darkest future. Weaknesses : * Cannot see you if you show no sorrow. - Echoes of the Past \u2013 The Seer can be weakened by playing an ancient melody that was once sung in the village. Players must find a way to reproduce this melody to disrupt her powers. [[Broken Music Box]] Abilities : - Causes visions of past grief. Absorbs spoken confessions to empower itself. - Curse of Silence \u2013 The Seer can curse a player, rendering them unable to speak or cast spells. This curse can only be lifted by defeating her or using a rare item found in the well (Mourner's Signet). Chart of Interesting Things (d6) : 1. Offers you a truth you didn\u2019t ask for 2. Cries in your voice 3. Leaves a tear on your relic 4. Begs for your name 5. Mimics a dead loved one 6. Bleeds ink into the water Treasure : - A single coin that removes one Burden when held - Veil of the Seer (Helm) \u2013 A ghostly veil that grants the wearer visions of the future but at the cost of their sanity. It also provides resistance to mind-affecting spells. - Ring of Echoes (Accessory) \u2013 A silver ring that allows the wearer to communicate telepathically with others but slowly causes them to hear the thoughts of everyone around them, leading to potential madness.

It is said the dead rise here not out of vengeance, but confusion, trying to finish lives long faded. The Whispering Marshes are a vast expanse of mist-covered wetlands surrounding the approach to [[Evershade]]. The ground is soft and treacherous, with twisted trees rising from the murky waters, their roots exposed like grasping fingers.

Those who follow them find themselves lost in the fog, surrounded by the whispering voices of the marsh. Usually a precursor to another are or [[Lantern Maw]] . The Bog Heart, where you are led, is a good place to harvest [[Feyheart Blossom]].

While chilly, the dampness is like humidity. A flower blooms as if watching the party pass. A corpse speaks a memory that belongs to someone in the group. The fog clears just enough to reveal a glimpse of a forgotten ruin, then closes again. The fog splits, revealing a drowned village beneath the water - a mirage or a prophecy? A Drowned King\u2019s shadow passes overhead. A fetid bloom releases spores that force hallucinations.","title":"Moments:"},{"location":"jorando/sets/Whispering%20Marshes/Whispering%20Marshes/#locations-traps-opportunities","text":"","title":"Locations / Traps / Opportunities:"},{"location":"jorando/sets/Whispering%20Marshes/Whispering%20Marshes/#the-shrouded-path","text":"A narrow, winding trail of firmer ground that leads through the marshes; the ostensible path to [[Evershade]].
